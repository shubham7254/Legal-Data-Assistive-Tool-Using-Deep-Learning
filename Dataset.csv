"Dipak Misra, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. The Appellant along one Avnish Bajaj and others was arrayed as an accused in FIR
No. 645 of 2004. After the investigation was concluded, charge sheet was filed before
the learned Metropolitan Magistrate who on 14.02.2006 took cognizance of the offences
punishable Under Sections 292 and 294 of the Indian Penal Code (Indian Penal Code)
and Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (for short, ""the IT Act"") against
all of them. Avnish Bajaj filed Criminal Misc. Case No. 3066 of 2006 for quashment of
the proceedings on many a ground before the High Court of Delhi which vide order
dated 29.05.2008 came to the conclusion that prima facie case was made out Under
Section 292 Indian Penal Code, but it expressed the opinion that Avinish Bajaj, the
Petitioner in the said case, was not liable to be proceeded Under Section 292 Indian
Penal Code and, accordingly, he was discharged of the offence Under Sections 292 and
294 Indian Penal Code. However, he was prima facie found to have committed offence
Under Section 67 read with Section 85 of the IT Act and the trial court was directed to
proceed to the next stage of passing of order of charge uninfluenced by the
observations made in the order of the High Court.
3 . Being grieved by the aforesaid order, Avnish Bajaj preferred Criminal Appeal No.
1483 of 2009. The said appeal was tagged with Ebay India Pvt. Ltd. v. State and
Anr. (Criminal Appeal No. 1484 of 2009). The said appeals were heard along with other
appeals that arose from the lis relating to interpretation of Sections 138 and 141 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short, ""NI Act"") by a three-Judge Bench as there
was difference of opinion between the two learned Judges in Aneeta Hada v.
Godfather Travels and Tours (P) Ltd. MANU/SC/2118/2008 : (2008) 13 SCC 703.
4. Regard being had to the pleas raised by Avnish Bajaj and also the similarity of issue
that arose in the context of NI Act, the three-Judge Bench stated the controversy that
emerged for consideration thus:
2. In Criminal Appeals Nos. 1483 and 1484 of 2009, the issue involved pertains
to the interpretation of Section 85 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (for
short ""the 2000 Act"") which is in pari materia with Section 141 of the Act. Be it
noted, a Director of the Appellant Company was prosecuted Under Section 292
of the Penal Code, 1860 and Section 67 of the 2000 Act without impleading the
Company as an accused. The initiation of prosecution was challenged Under
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the High Court and the
High Court held that offences are made out against the Appellant Company
along with the Directors Under Section 67 read with Section 85 of the 2000 Act
and, on the said base, declined to quash the proceeding.
3 . The core issue that has emerged in these two appeals is whether the
Company could have been made liable for prosecution without being impleaded
as an accused and whether the Directors could have been prosecuted for
offences punishable under the aforesaid provisions without the Company being
arrayed as an accused.
5. In the context of Section 141 of NI Act, the Court ruled thus:
5 8 . Applying the doctrine of strict construction, we are of the considered
opinion that commission of offence by the company is an express condition
precedent to attract the vicarious liability of others. Thus, the words ""as well as
the company"" appearing in the Section make it absolutely unmistakably clear
that when the company can be prosecuted, then only the persons mentioned in
the other categories could be vicariously liable for the offence subject to the
averments in the petition and proof thereof. One cannot be oblivious of the fact
that the company is a juristic person and it has its own respectability. If a
finding is recorded against it, it would create a concavity in its reputation.
There can be situations when the corporate reputation is affected when a
Director is indicted.
6. As far as the appeal of Avnish Bajaj is concerned, the Court referred to Section 85 of
the IT Act which is as follows:
85. Offences by companies.--(1) Where a person committing a contravention
of any of the provisions of this Act or of any rule, direction or order made
thereunder is a company, every person who, at the time the contravention was
committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the
conduct of business of the company as well as the company, shall be guilty of
the contravention and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished
accordingly:
Provided that nothing contained in this Sub-section shall render any
such person liable to punishment if he proves that the contravention
took place without his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence
to prevent such contravention.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (1), where a
contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or of any rule, direction or
order made thereunder has been committed by a company and it is proved that
the contravention has taken place with the consent or connivance of, or is
attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or
other officer of the company, such director, manager, secretary or other officer
shall also be deemed to be guilty of the contravention and shall be liable to be
proceeded against and punished accordingly.
7. Interpreting the same, the Court opined thus:
6 4 . Keeping in view the anatomy of the aforesaid provision, our analysis
pertaining to Section 141 of the Act would squarely apply to the 2000
enactment. Thus adjudged, the Director could not have been held liable for the
offence Under Section 85 of the 2000 Act. Resultantly, Criminal Appeal No.
1483 of 2009 is allowed and the proceeding against the Appellant is quashed.
As far as the Company is concerned, it was not arraigned as an accused. Ergo,
the proceeding as initiated in the existing incarnation is not maintainable either
against the company or against the Director. As a logical sequitur, the appeals
are allowed and the proceedings initiated against Avnish Bajaj as well as the
Company in the present form are quashed.
8 . After the judgment was delivered, the present Appellant filed an application before
the trial court to drop the proceedings against him. The trial court partly allowed the
application and dropped the proceedings against the Appellant for offences Under
Section 294 Indian Penal Code and Section 67 of the IT Act, however, proceedings
Under Section 292 Indian Penal Code were not dropped, and vide order 22.12.2014, the
trial court framed the charge Under Section 292 Indian Penal Code.
9. Being aggrieved by the order framing of charge, the Appellant moved the High Court
in Criminal Revision No. 127 of 2015 and the learned Single Judge by the impugned
order declined to interfere on the ground that there is sufficient material showing
Appellant's involvement to proceed against him for the commission of the offence
punishable Under Section 292 Indian Penal Code. It has referred to the allegations made
against him and the responsibility of the Appellant and thereafter referred to the
pronouncements in P. Vijayan v. State of Kerala and Anr. MANU/SC/0058/2010 :
(2010) 2 SCC 398 and Amit Kapoor v. Ramesh Chander and Anr.
MANU/SC/0746/2012 : (2012) 9 SCC 460 which pertain to exercise of revisional power
of the High Court while dealing with propriety of framing of charge Under Section 228
of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
10. The central issue that arises for consideration is whether the Appellant who has
been discharged Under Section 67 of the IT Act could be proceeded Under Section 292
Indian Penal Code.
11. Be it noted, on the first date of hearing, Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned senior Counsel
appearing for the Appellant urged that the dispute raised require interpretation of
various provisions of the IT Act and bearing that in mind, the Court thought it
appropriate to hear the learned Attorney General for the Union of India. In the course of
hearing, the Court was assisted by Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned Attorney General for
India, Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned Solicitor General and Mr. R.K. Rathore, learned Counsel
for the Union of India.
12. It is not disputed that the Appellant is the senior manager of the intermediary and
the managing director of the intermediary has been discharged of all the offences as per
the decision in Aneeta Hada (supra) and further that singular charge that has been
framed against the Appellant is in respect of Section 292 Indian Penal Code. It is
submitted by Dr. Singhvi that the Appellant could not have been proceeded Under
Section 292 Indian Penal Code after having been discharged Under Section 67 of the IT
Act. Mr. Rohatgi, learned Attorney General assisting the Court submitted that Section 67
of the IT Act is a special provision and it will override Section 292 Indian Penal Code.
He has made a distinction between the offences referable to the internet and the
offences referable to print/conventional media or whatever is expressed in Section 292
Indian Penal Code. Mr. D.S. Mahra, learned Counsel appearing for the NCT of Delhi,
would contend that publishing any obscene material as stipulated Under Section 67 of
the IT Act cannot be confused or equated with sale of obscene material as given Under
Section 292 Indian Penal Code, for the two offences are entirely different. It is urged by
him that an accused can be charged and tried for an offence independently Under
Section 292 Indian Penal Code even if he has been discharged Under Section 67 of the
IT Act. According to him, there is no bar in law to charge and try for the offence Under
Section 292 Indian Penal Code after discharge from Section 67 of the IT Act. Learned
Counsel would further contend that the role of person in charge of the intermediary is
extremely vital as it pertains to sale of obscene material which is punishable Under
Section 292 Indian Penal Code and not Under Section 67 of the IT Act. It is put forth by
the learned Counsel that the plea advanced by the Appellant is in the realm of
technicalities and on that ground, the order of charge should not be interfered with.
13. Dr. Singhvi has taken us through the legislative history of proscription of obscenity
in India. He has referred to the Obscene Books and Pictures Act, 1856. The primary
object of the said Act was to prevent the sale or exposure of obscene books and picture.
It prohibited singing of obscene songs, etc. to the annoyance of others. Any person
found indulging in the said activities was liable to pay a fine of Rs. 100/- or to
imprisonment up to 3 years or both. Be it noted, learned senior Counsel has also
referred to the Obscene Publications Act, 1925. The said Act has been repealed.
14. Section 292 Indian Penal Code in its original shape read as follows:
292. Sale, etc., of obscene books, etc.--Whoever--
(a) sells, lets to hire, distributes, publicly exhibits or in any manner
puts into circulation, or for purposes of sale, hire, distribution, public
exhibition or circulation, makes, produces or has in his possession any
obscene book, pamphlet, paper, drawing, painting, representation or
figure or any other obscene object whatsoever, or
(b) imports, exports or conveys any obscene object for any of the
purposes aforesaid, or knowing or having reason to believe that such
object will be sold, let to hire, distributed or publicly exhibited or in
any manner put into circulation, or
(c) takes part in or receives profits from any business in the course of
which he knows or has reason to believe that any such obscene objects
are for any of the purposes aforesaid, made, produced, purchased,
kept, imported, exported, conveyed, publicly exhibited or in any
manner put into circulation, or
(d) advertises or makes known by any means whatsoever that any
person is engaged or is ready to engage in any act which is an offence
under this section, or that any such obscene object can be procured
from or through any person, or
(e) offers or attempts to do any act which is an offence under this
section,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to three months, or with fine, or with both.
Exception.--This Section does not extend to any book, pamphlet, paper,
writing, drawing or painting kept or used bona fide for religious purposes or
any representation sculptured, engraved, painted or otherwise represented on
or in any temple, or on any car used for the conveyance or idols, or kept or
used for any religious purpose.
1 5 . The constitutional validity of Section 292 Indian Penal Code was challenged in
Ranjit D. Udeshi v. State of Maharashtra MANU/SC/0080/1964 : AIR 1965 SC 881.
Assailing the constitutional validity, it was urged before the Constitution Bench that the
said provision imposes incompatible and unacceptable restrictions on the freedom of
speech and expression guaranteed Under Section (sic Article) 19(1)(a) of the
Constitution. The Constitution Bench opined as follows:
7. No doubt this Article guarantees complete freedom of speech and expression
but it also makes an exception in favour of existing laws which impose
restrictions on the exercise of the right in the interests of public decency or
morality. The Section of the Penal Code in dispute was introduced by the
Obscene Publications Act (7 of 1925) to give effect to Article 1 of the
International' Convention for the suppression of or traffic in obscene
publications signed by India in 1923 at Geneva. It does not go beyond
obscenity which falls directly within the words ""public decency (1) (1868) L.R.
3 Q.B. 360. and morality"" of the second Clause of the article. The word, as the
dictionaries tell us, denotes the quality of being obscene which means offensive
to modesty or decency; lewd, filthy and repulsive. It cannot be denied that it is
an important interest of society to suppress obscenity. There is, of course,
some difference between obscenity and pornography in that the latter denotes
writings, pictures etc. intended to arouse sexual desire while the former may
include writings etc. not intended to do so but which have that tendency. Both,
of course, offend against public decency and morals but pornography is
obscenity in a more aggravated form. Mr. Garg seeks to limit action to cases of
intentional lewdness which he describes as ""dirt for dirt's sake"" and which has
now received the appellation of hard-core pornography by which term is meant
libidinous writings of high erotic effect unredeemed by anything literary or
artistic and intended to arouse, sexual feelings.
xxxx
9. The former he thought so because it dealt with excretory functions and the
latter because it dealt-with sex repression. (See Sex, Literature and Censorship
pp. 26 201). Condemnation of obscenity depends as much upon the mores of
the people as upon the individual. It is always a question of degree or as the
lawyers are accustomed to say, of where the line is to be drawn. It is, however,
clear that obscenity by itself has extremely ""poor value in the-propagation of
ideas, opinions and information of public interest or profit."" When there is
propagation of ideas, opinions and information of public interest or profit, the
approach to the problem may become different because then the interest of
society may tilt the scales in favour of free speech and expression. It is thus
that books on medical science with intimate illustrations and photographs,
though in a sense immodest, are not considered to be obscene but the same
illustrations and photographs collected in book form without the medical text
would certainly be considered to be obscene. Section 292, Indian Penal Code
deals with obscenity in this sense and cannot thus be said to be invalid in view
of the second Clause of Article 19.
16. Eventually, the Court upheld the constitutional validity of the said provision. After
the pronouncement by the Constitution Bench, the legislature amended Section 292
which presently reads thus:
292. Sale, etc., of obscene books, etc.--(1) For the purposes of Sub-section
(2), book, pamphlet, paper, writing, drawing, painting, representation, figure or
any other object, shall be deemed to be obscene if it is lascivious or appeals to
the prurient interest or if its effect, or (where it comprises two or more distinct
items) the effect of any one of its items, is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend
to deprave and corrupt person who are likely, having regard to all relevant
circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.
(2) Whoever--
(a) sells, lets to hire, distributes, publicly exhibits or in any manner
puts into circulation, or for purposes of sale, hire, distribution, public
exhibition or circulation, makes, produces or has in his possession any
obscene book, pamphlet, paper, drawing, painting, representation or
figure or any other obscene object whatsoever, or
(b) imports, exports or conveys any obscene object for any of the
purposes aforesaid, or knowing or having reason to believe that such
object will be sold, let to hire, distributed or publicly exhibited or in
any manner put into circulation, or
(c) takes part in or receives profits from any business in the course of
which he knows or has reason to believe that any such obscene objects
are, for any of the purposes aforesaid, made, produced, purchased,
kept, imported, exported, conveyed, publicly exhibited or in any
manner put into circulation, or
(d) advertises or makes known by any means whatsoever that any
person is engaged or is ready to engage in any act which is an offence
under this section, or that any such obscene object can be procured
from or through any person, or
(e) offers or attempts to do any act which is an offence under this
section,
shall be punished on first conviction with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to two years, and with fine
which may extend to two thousand rupees, and, in the event of a
second or subsequent conviction, with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to five years, and also with
fine which may extend to five thousand rupees.
Exception.--This Section does not extend to--
(a) any book, pamphlet, paper, writing, drawing, painting,
representation or figure--
(i) the publication of which is proved to be justified as being
for the public good on the ground that such book, pamphlet,
paper, writing, drawing, painting, representation or figure is in
the interest of science, literature, art or learning or other
objects of general concern, or
(ii) which is kept or used bona fide for religious purposes;
(b) any representation sculptured, engraved, painted or otherwise
represented on or in--
(i) any ancient monument within the meaning of the Ancient
Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958
(24 of 1958), or
(ii) any temple, or on any car used for the conveyance of idols,
or kept or used for any religious purpose.
17. At the outset, we may clarify that though learned Counsel for the Appellant has
commended us to certain authorities with regard to role of the Appellant, the concept of
possession and how the possession is not covered Under Section 292 Indian Penal
Code, we are not disposed to enter into the said arenas. We shall only restrict to the
interpretative aspect as already stated. To appreciate the said facet, it is essential to
understand certain provisions that find place in the IT Act and how the Court has
understood the same. That apart, it is really to be seen whether an activity emanating
from electronic form which may be obscene would be punishable Under Section 292
Indian Penal Code or Section 67 of the IT Act or both or any other provision of the IT
Act.
18. On a perusal of material on record, it is beyond dispute that the alleged possession
of material constitutes the electronic record as defined Under Section 2(1)(t) of the IT
Act. The dictionary Clause reads as follows:
Section 2(1)(t). electronic record"" means data, record or data generated, image
or sound stored, received or sent in an electronic form or micro film or
computer generated micro fiche;
Thus, the offence in question relates to electronic record.
19. In Shreya Singhal v. Union of India MANU/SC/0329/2015 : (2015) 5 SCC 1, the
Court was dealing with constitutional validity of Section 66-A of the IT Act and the two-
Judge Bench declared the said provision as unconstitutional by stating thus:
85. These two cases illustrate how judicially trained minds would find a person
guilty or not guilty depending upon the Judge's notion of what is ""grossly
offensive"" or ""menacing"". In Collins case, both the Leicestershire Justices and
two Judges of the Queen's Bench would have acquitted Collins whereas the
House of Lords convicted him. Similarly, in the Chambers case, the Crown
Court would have convicted Chambers whereas the Queen's Bench acquitted
him. If judicially trained minds can come to diametrically opposite conclusions
on the same set of facts it is obvious that expressions such as ""grossly
offensive"" or ""menacing"" are so vague that there is no manageable standard by
which a person can be said to have committed an offence or not to have
committed an offence. Quite obviously, a prospective offender of Section 66-A
and the authorities who are to enforce Section 66-A have absolutely no
manageable standard by which to book a person for an offence Under Section
66-A. This being the case, having regard also to the two English precedents
cited by the learned Additional Solicitor General, it is clear that Section 66-A is
unconstitutionally vague.
86. Ultimately, applying the tests referred to in Chintaman Rao v. State of M.P.
MANU/SC/0008/1950 : AIR 1951 SC 118 and State of Madras v. V.G. Row
MANU/SC/0013/1952 : AIR 1952 SC 196 case, referred to earlier in the
judgment, it is clear that Section 66-A arbitrarily, excessively and
disproportionately invades the right of free speech and upsets the balance
between such right and the reasonable restrictions that may be imposed on
such right.
2 0 . Thereafter the Court referred to Kameshwar Prasad vs. State of Bihar
MANU/SC/0410/1962 : 1962 Supp. (3) SCR 369 : AIR 1962 SC 1166 andC entral
Prison v. Ram Manohar Lohia MANU/SC/0058/1960 : AIR 1960 SC 633 and came to
hold as follows:
94. These two Constitution Bench decisions bind us and would apply directly
on Section 66-A. We, therefore, hold that the Section is unconstitutional also
on the ground that it takes within its sweep protected speech and speech that is
innocent in nature and is liable therefore to be used in such a way as to have a
chilling effect on free speech and would, therefore, have to be struck down on
the ground of overbreadth.
21. While dealing with obscenity, the Curt referred to Ranjit D. Udeshi (supra) and
other decisions and opined thus:
48. This Court in Ranjit D. Udeshi v. State of Maharashtra (supra) took a rather
restrictive view of what would pass muster as not being obscene. The Court
followed the test laid down in the old English judgment in R. v. Hicklin (1868)
LR 3 QB 360 which was whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscene
is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral
influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall. Great
strides have been made since this decision in the U.K., the United States as well
as in our country. Thus, in Directorate General of Doordarshan v. Anand
Patwardhan MANU/SC/3637/2006 : (2006) 8 SCC 433 this Court noticed the
law in the United States and said that a material may be regarded as obscene if
the average person applying contemporary community standards would find
that the subject-matter taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest and
that taken as a whole it otherwise lacks serious literary, artistic, political,
educational or scientific value (see para 31).
4 9 . In a recent judgment of this Court, Aveek Sarkar v. State of W.B.
MANU/SC/0081/2014 : (2014) 4 SCC 257, this Court referred to English, US
and Canadian judgments and moved away from the Hicklin (supra) test and
applied the contemporary community standards test.
5 0 . What has been said with regard to public order and incitement to an
offence equally applies here. Section 66-A cannot possibly be said to create an
offence which falls within the expression ""decency"" or ""morality"" in that what
may be grossly offensive or annoying under the Section need not be obscene at
all--in fact the word ""obscene"" is conspicuous by its absence in Section 66-A.
2 2 . I n Devidas Ramachandra Tuljapurkar v. State of Maharashtra and Ors.
MANU/SC/0612/2015 : (2015) 6 SCC 1 analyzing the said judgment another two-Judge
Bench has opined that as far as test of obscenity is concerned, the prevalent test is the
contemporary community standards test. It is apt to note here that in the said case the
Court was dealing with the issue, what kind of test is to be applied when personalitie
like Mahatma Gandhi are alluded. The Court held:
1 4 2 . When the name of Mahatma Gandhi is alluded or used as a symbol,
speaking or using obscene words, the concept of ""degree"" comes in. To
elaborate, the ""contemporary community standards test"" becomes applicable
with more vigour, in a greater degree and in an accentuated manner. What can
otherwise pass of the contemporary community standards test for use of the
same language, it would not be so, if the name of Mahatma Gandhi is used as a
symbol or allusion or surrealistic voice to put words or to show him doing such
acts which are obscene. While so concluding, we leave it to the poet to put his
defence at the trial explaining the manner in which he has used the words and
in what context. We only opine that view of the High Court pertaining to the
framing of charge Under Section 292 Indian Penal Code cannot be flawed.
23. Reference to Shreya Singhal (supra) is only to show that in the said case the
Court while dealing with constitutional validity of Section 66-A of the IT Act noticed that
the said provision conspicuously did not have the word ""obscene"". It did not say
anything else in that regard. In the case at hand, it is required to be seen in which of
the provision or both an accused is required to be tried. We have already reproduced
Section 292 Indian Penal Code in the present incarnation. Section 67 of the IT Act which
provides for punishment for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic
form reads as follows:
67. Punishment for publishing or transmitting obscene material in
electronic form.-Whoever publishes or transmits or causes to be published or
transmitted in the electronic form, any material which is lascivious or appeals
to the prurient interest or if its effect is such as to tend to deprave and corrupt
persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see
or hear the matter contained or embodied in it, shall be punished on first
conviction with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend
to three years and with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees and in the
event of second or subsequent conviction with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to five years and also with fine which
may extend to ten lakh rupees.
2 4 . Section 67A stipulates punishment for publishing or transmitting of material
containing sexually explicit act, etc., in electronic form. Section 67B provides for
punishment for publishing or transmitting of material depicting children in sexually
explicit act, etc., in electronic form. It is as follows:
67B. Punishment for publishing or transmitting of material depicting
children in sexually explicit act, etc., in electronic form.-Whoever-
(a) publishes or transmits or causes to be published or transmitted
material any electronic form which depicts children engaged in sexually
explicit act or conduct; or
(b) creates text or digital images, collects, seeks, browses, downloads,
advertises, promotes, exchanges or distributes material in any
electronic form depicting children in obscene or indecent or sexually
explicit manner; or
(c) cultivates, entices or induces children to online relationship with
one or more children for and on sexually explicit act or in a manner
that may offend a reasonable adult on the computer resources; or
(d) facilitates abusing children online; or
(e) records in any electronic form own abuse or that of others
pertaining to sexually explicit act with children,
shall be punished on first conviction with imprisonment of either description for
a term which may extend to five years and with a fine which may extend to ten
lakh rupees and in the event of second or subsequent conviction with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years
and also with fine which may extend to ten lakh rupees:
Provided that provisions of Section 67, Section 67A and this Section
does not extend to any book, pamphlet, paper, writing, drawing,
painting representation or figure in electronic form-
(i) the publication of which is proved to be justified as being
for the public good on the ground that such book, pamphlet,
paper, writing drawing, painting representation or figure is in
the interest of science, literature, art or learning or other
objects of general concern; or
(ii) which is kept or used for bona fide heritage or religious
purposes.
Explanation.-For the purpose of this Section ""children"" means a person who has
not completed the age of 18 years.
25. Section 69 of the IT Act provides for power to issue directions for interception or
monitoring or decryption of any information through any computer resource. It also
carries a penal facet inasmuch as it states that the subscriber or intermediary who fails
to comply with the directions issued under Sub-section (3) shall be punished with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to
fine.
26. We have referred to all these provisions of the IT Act only to lay stress that the
legislature has deliberately used the words ""electronic form"". Dr. Singhvi has brought to
our notice Section 79 of the IT Act that occurs in Chapter XII dealing with
intermediaries not to be liable in certain cases. Learned Counsel has also relied on
Shreya Singhal (supra) as to how the Court has dealt with the challenge to Section 79
of the IT Act. The Court has associated the said provision with exemption and Section
69A and in that context, expressed that:
121. It must first be appreciated that Section 79 is an exemption provision.
Being an exemption provision, it is closely related to provisions which provide
for offences including Section 69-A. We have seen how Under Section 69-A
blocking can take place only by a reasoned order after complying with several
procedural safeguards including a hearing to the originator and intermediary.
We have also seen how there are only two ways in which a blocking order can
be passed--one by the Designated Officer after complying with the 2009 Rules
and the other by the Designated Officer when he has to follow an order passed
by a competent court. The intermediary applying its own mind to whether
information should or should not be blocked is noticeably absent in Section 69-
A read with the 2009 Rules.
122. Section 79(3)(b) has to be read down to mean that the intermediary upon
receiving actual knowledge that a court order has been passed asking it to
expeditiously remove or disable access to certain material must then fail to
expeditiously remove or disable access to that material. This is for the reason
that otherwise it would be very difficult for intermediaries like Google,
Facebook, etc. to act when millions of requests are made and the intermediary
is then to judge as to which of such requests are legitimate and which are not.
We have been informed that in other countries worldwide this view has gained
acceptance, Argentina being in the forefront. Also, the Court order and/or the
notification by the appropriate Government or its agency must strictly conform
to the subject-matters laid down in Article 19(2). Unlawful acts beyond what is
laid down in Article 19(2) obviously cannot form any part of Section 79. With
these two caveats, we refrain from striking down Section 79(3)(b).
123. The learned Additional Solicitor General informed us that it is a common
practice worldwide for intermediaries to have user agreements containing what
is stated in Rule 3(2). However, Rule 3(4) needs to be read down in the same
manner as Section 79(3)(b). The knowledge spoken of in the said Sub-rule
must only be through the medium of a court order. Subject to this, the
Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011 are valid.
27. We have referred to the aforesaid aspect as it has been argued by Dr. Singhvi that
the Appellant is protected under the said provision, even if the entire allegations are
accepted. According to him, once the factum of electronic record is admitted, Section 79
of the IT Act must apply ipso facto and ipso jure. Learned senior Counsel has urged
Section 79, as the language would suggest and keeping in view the paradigm of internet
world where service providers of platforms do not control and indeed cannot control the
acts/omissions of primary, secondary and tertiary users of such internet platforms,
protects the intermediary till he has the actual knowledge. He would contend that Act
has created a separate and distinct category called 'originator' in terms of Section 2(1)
(z)(a) under the IT Act to which the protection Under Section 79 of the IT Act has been
consciously not extended. Relying on the decision in Shreya Singhal (supra), he has
urged that the horizon has been expanded and the effect of Section 79 of the IT Act
provides protection to the individual since the provision has been read down
emphasizing on the conception of actual knowledge. Relying on the said provision, it is
further canvassed by him that Section 79 of the IT Act gets automatically attracted to
electronic forms of publication and transmission by intermediaries, since it explicitly
uses the non-obstante clauses and has an overriding effect on any other law in force.
Thus, the emphasis is on the three provisions, namely, Sections 67, 79 and 81, and the
three provisions, according to Dr. Singhvi, constitute a holistic trinity. In this regard,
we may reproduce Section 81 of the IT Act, which is as follows:
81. Act to have overriding effect.-The provisions of this Act shall have
effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other
law for the time being in force.
Provided that nothing contained in this Act shall restrict any person from
exercising any right conferred under the Copyright Act 1957 or the Patents Act
1970.
The proviso has been inserted by Act 10 of 2009 w.e.f. 27.10.2009.
2 8 . Having noted the provisions, it has to be recapitulated that Section 67 clearly
stipulates punishment for publishing, transmitting obscene materials in electronic form.
The said provision read with Section 67A and 67B is a complete code relating to the
offences that are covered under the IT Act. Section 79, as has been interpreted, is an
exemption provision conferring protection to the individuals. However, the said
protection has been expanded in the dictum of Shreya Singhal (supra) and we concur
with the same. Section 81 also specifically provides that the provisions of the Act shall
have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law
for the time being in force. All provisions will have their play and significance, if the
alleged offence pertains to offence of electronic record. It has to be borne in mind that
IT Act is a special enactment. It has special provisions. Section 292 of the Indian Penal
Code makes offence sale of obscene books, etc. but once the offence has a nexus or
connection with the electronic record the protection and effect of Section 79 cannot be
ignored and negated. We are inclined to think so as it is a special provision for a
specific purpose and the Act has to be given effect to so as to make the protection
effective and true to the legislative intent. This is the mandate behind Section 81 of the
IT Act. The additional protection granted by the IT Act would apply. In this regard, we
may refer to Sarwan Singh and Anr. v. Kasturi Lal MANU/SC/0071/1976 : (1977) 1
SCC 750. The Court was considering Section 39 of Slum Areas (Improvement and
Clearance) Act, 1956 which laid down that the provisions of the said Act and the Rules
made thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith
contained in any other law. The Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 also contained nonobstante
clauses. Interpreting the same, the Court held:
When two or more laws operate in the same field and each contains a nonobstante
Clause stating that its provisions will override those of any other law,
stimulating and incisive problems of interpretation arise. Since statutory
interpretation has no conventional protocol, cases of such conflict have to be
decided in reference to the object and purpose of the laws under consideration.
A piquant situation, like the one before us, arose in Shri Ram Narain v. Simla
Banking & Industrial Co. Ltd. MANU/SC/0003/1956 : AIR 1956 SC 614 the
competing statutes being the Banking Companies Act, 1949 as amended by Act
52 of 1953, and the Displaced Persons (Debts Adjustment) Act, 1951. Section
45-A of the Banking Companies Act, which was introduced by the amending Act
of 1953, and Section 3 of the Displaced Persons Act, 1951 contained each a
non-obstante clause, providing that certain provisions would have effect
""notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for
the time being in force..."". This Court resolved the conflict by considering the
object and purpose of the two laws and giving precedence to the Banking
Companies Act by observing:
It is, therefore, desirable to determine the overriding effect of one or
the other of the relevant provisions in these two Acts, in a given case,
on much broader considerations of the purpose and policy underlying
the two Acts and the clear intendment conveyed by the language of the
relevant provisions therein (p. 615)
As indicated by us, the special and specific purpose which motivated the
enactment of Section 14-A and Chapter III-A of the Delhi Rent Act would be
wholly frustrated if the provisions of the Slum Clearance Act requiring
permission of the competent authority were to prevail over them. Therefore, the
newly introduced provisions of the Delhi Rent Act must hold the field and be
given full effect despite anything to the contrary contained in the Slum
2 9 . I n Talcher Municipality v. Talcher Regulated Market Committee
MANU/SC/0559/2004 : (2004) 6 SCC 178, the Court was dealing with the question
whether the Orissa Municipal Act, 1950 or Orissa Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1956
should apply. Section 4(4) of the 1956 Act contained a non-obstante clause. In that
context, the Court opined:
The Act, however, contains special provisions. The provision of Section 4(4) of
the said Act operates notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any
other law for the time being in force. The provisions of the said Act, therefore,
would prevail over the provisions of the Orissa Municipal Act. The maxim
""generalia specialibus non derogant"" would, thus, be applicable in this case.
(See D.R. Yadav v. R.K. Singh MANU/SC/0472/2003 : (2003) 7 SCC 110,I ndian
Handicrafts Emporium v. Union of India MANU/SC/0640/2003 : (2003) 7 SCC
589 and M.P. Vidyut Karamchari Sangh v. M.P. Electricity Board
MANU/SC/0237/2004 : (2004) 9 SCC 755.)
3 0 . I n Ram Narain (supra), the Court faced a situation where both the statutes,
namely, Banking Companies Act, 1949 and the Displaced Persons (Debts Adjustment)
Act, 1951 contained non-obstante clause. The Court gave primacy to the Banking
Companies Act. To arrive at the said conclusion, the Court evolved the following
principle:
7. ... It is, therefore, desirable to determine the overriding effect of one or the
other of the relevant provisions in these two Acts, in a given case, on much
broader considerations of the purpose and policy underlying the two Acts and
the clear intendment conveyed by the language of the relevant provisions
therein.
3 1 . I n Solidaire India Ltd. v. Fairgrowth Financial Services Ltd.
MANU/SC/0009/2001 : (2001) 3 SCC 71, this Court while dealing with two special
statutes, namely, Section 13 of Special Court (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions
in Securities) Act, 1992 and Section 32 of Sick Industrial Companies (Special
Provisions) Act, 1985, observed as follows:
Where there are two special statutes which contain non obstante clauses the
later statute must prevail. This is because at the time of enactment of the later
statute, the Legislature was aware of the earlier legislation and its non obstante
clause. If the Legislature still confers the later enactment with a non obstante
Clause it means that the Legislature wanted that enactment to prevail. If the
Legislature does not want the later enactment to prevail then it could and would
provide in the later enactment that the provisions of the earlier enactment
continue to apply.
32. The aforesaid passage clearly shows that if legislative intendment is discernible that
a latter enactment shall prevail, the same is to be interpreted in accord with the said
intention. We have already referred to the scheme of the IT Act and how obscenity
pertaining to electronic record falls under the scheme of the Act. We have also referred
to Sections 79 and 81 of the IT Act. Once the special provisions having the overriding
effect do cover a criminal act and the offender, he gets out of the net of the Indian
Penal Code and in this case, Section 292. It is apt to note here that electronic forms of
transmission is covered by the IT Act, which is a special law. It is settled position in law
that a special law shall prevail over the general and prior laws. When the Act in various
provisions deals with obscenity in electronic form, it covers the offence Under Section
292 Indian Penal Code.
33. In Jeewan Kumar Raut v. CBI MANU/SC/1153/2009 : (2009) 7 SCC 526, in the
context of Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 (TOHO) treating it as a special
law, the Court held:
2 2 . TOHO being a special statute, Section 4 of the Code, which ordinarily
would be applicable for investigation into a cognizable offence or the other
provisions, may not be applicable. Section 4 provides for investigation, inquiry,
trial, etc. according to the provisions of the Code. Sub-section (2) of Section 4,
however, specifically provides that offences under any other law shall be
investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the same
provisions, but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating
the manner or place of investigating, inquiring into, tried or otherwise dealing
with such offences.
23. TOHO being a special Act and the matter relating to dealing with offences
thereunder having been regulated by reason of the provisions thereof, there
cannot be any manner of doubt whatsoever that the same shall prevail over the
provisions of the Code.
And again:
27. The provisions of the Code, thus, for all intent and purport, would apply
only to an extent till conflict arises between the provisions of the Code and
TOHO and as soon as the area of conflict reaches, TOHO shall prevail over the
Code. Ordinarily, thus, although in terms of the Code, the Respondent upon
completion of investigation and upon obtaining remand of the accused from
time to time, was required to file a police report, it was precluded from doing
so by reason of the provisions contained in Section 22 of TOHO.
34. In view of the aforesaid analysis and the authorities referred to hereinabove, we are
of the considered opinion that the High Court has fallen into error that though charge
has not been made out Under Section 67 of the IT Act, yet the Appellant could be
proceeded Under Section 292 Indian Penal Code.
35. Consequently, the appeal is allowed, the orders passed by the High Court and the
trial court are set aside and the criminal prosecution lodged against the Appellant
stands quashed.

Facts:
The Appellant along with co-Accused and others was arrayed as an Accused.
After the investigation was concluded, charge sheet was filed before the
Metropolitan Magistrate who took cognizance of the offences punishable
under Sections 292 and 294 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Section 67 of
the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) against all of them. The co-
Accused filed case for quashment of the proceedings on many a ground before
the High Court which concluded that prima facie case was made out under
Section 292 of Indian Penal Code, but it expressed the opinion that the co-
Accused in the said case, was not liable to be proceeded under Section 292 of
Indian Penal Code and, accordingly, he was discharged of the offence under
Sections 292 and 294 of Indian Penal Code. However, he was prima facie
found to have committed offence under Section 67 read with Section 85 of
the IT Act and the Trial Court was directed to proceed to the next stage of
passing of order of charge uninfluenced by the observations made in the order
of the High Court. Being grieved by that order, co-Accused preferred appeal.
The said appeal was tagged with other appeal. The said appeals were heard
along with other appeals that arose from the lis relating to interpretation of
Sections 138 and 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (NI Act) by a
three-Judge Bench as there was difference of opinion between the two
Judges in Aneeta Hada v. Godfather Travels and Tours (P) Ltd. The three-
Judge Bench held that the Director could not have been held liable for the
offence under Section 85 of the IT Act. Resultantly, appeal was allowed and
the proceeding against the co-Accused was quashed. As far as the Company
was concerned, it was not arraigned as an Accused. Ergo, the proceeding as
initiated in the existing incarnation was not maintainable either against the
company or against the Director. After the judgment was delivered, the
Appellant filed an application before the Trial Court to drop the proceedings
against him. The Trial Court partly allowed the application and dropped the
proceedings against the Appellant for offences under Section 294 of Indian
Penal Code and Section 67 of the IT Act, however, proceedings under Section
292 of Indian Penal Code were not dropped, and the Trial Court framed the
charge under Section 292 of Indian Penal Code.
Being aggrieved by the order framing of charge, the Appellant moved the High
Court and the Single Judge by the impugned order declined to interfere on the
ground that there was sufficient material showing Appellant's involvement to
proceed against him for the commission of the offence punishable under
Section 292 of Indian Penal Code. It referred to the allegations made against
him and the responsibility of the Appellant and thereafter referred to the
pronouncements in P. Vijayan v. State of Kerala and Anr. and Amit Kapoor v.
Ramesh Chander and Anr. which pertain to exercise of revisional power of the
High Court while dealing with propriety of framing of charge under Section
228 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Hence, the present appeal.
Held, while allowing the appeal:
(i) Section 67 clearly stipulates punishment for publishing, transmitting
obscene materials in electronic form. The said provision read with Section
67A and 67B is a complete code relating to the offences that are covered
under the IT Act. Section 79 is an exemption provision conferring protection
to the individuals. Section 81 also specifically provides that the provisions of
the Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith
contained in any other law for the time being in force. All provisions will have
their play and significance, if the alleged offence pertains to offence of
electronic record. The IT Act is a special enactment. It has special provisions.
Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code makes offence sale of obscene books,
etc. but once the offence has a nexus or connection with the electronic record
the protection and effect of Section 79 cannot be ignored and negated. It is a
special provision for a specific purpose and the Act has to be given effect to so
as to make the protection effective and true to the legislative intent. This is
the mandate behind Section 81 of the IT Act. The additional protection
granted by the IT Act would apply. [28]
(ii) If legislative intendment is discernible that a latter enactment shall
prevail, the same is to be interpreted in accord with the said intention. Once
the special provisions having the overriding effect do cover a criminal act and
the offender, he gets out of the net of the Indian Penal Code and in this case,
Section 292. The electronic forms of transmission is covered by the IT Act,
which is a special law. It is settled position in law that a special law shall
prevail over the general and prior laws. When the Act in various provisions
deals with obscenity in electronic form, it covers the offence under Section
292 of Indian Penal Code. [32]
(iii) The High Court had fallen into error that though charge had not been
made out under Section 67 of the IT Act, yet the Appellant could be
proceeded under Section 292 of Indian Penal Code. The orders passed by the
High Court and the Trial Court were set aside and the criminal prosecution
lodged against the Appellant stood quashed. [34] and[35]",,,,
"Adarsh Kumar Goel, J.
1. This appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 8th May, 2014
passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 1170 of
2011.
2. Question for consideration is whether in the facts of the present case, the dishonour
of a post-dated cheque given for repayment of loan installment which is also described
as ""security"" in the loan agreement is covered by Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act, 1881 (""the Act"").
3. The Appellant is Director of the company whose cheques have been dishonoured and
who is also the co-accused. The company is engaged in the field of power generation.
The Respondent is engaged in development of renewable energy and is a Government
of India enterprise. Vide the loan agreement dated 15th March, 2001, the Respondent
agreed to advance loan of Rs. 11.50 crores for setting up of 4.00 MW Biomass based
Power Project in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The agreement recorded that post-dated
cheques towards payment of installment of loan (principal and interest) were given by
way of security. The text of this part of the agreement is quoted in the later part of this
order. The cheques carried different dates depending on the dates when the installments
were due and upon dishonour thereof, complaints including the one dated 27th
September, 2002 were filed by the Respondent in the court of the concerned Magistrate
at New Delhi.
4. The Appellant approached the High Court to seek quashing of the complaints arising
out of 18 cheques of the value of about Rs. 10.3 crores. Contention of the Appellant in
support of his case was that the cheques were given by way of security as mentioned in
the agreement and that on the date the cheques were issued, no debt or liability was
due. Thus, dishonour of post-dated cheques given by way of security did not fall Under
Section 138 of the Act. Reliance was placed on Clause 3.1 (iii) of the agreement to the
effect that deposit of post-dated cheques toward repayment of installments was by way
of ""security"". Even the first installment as per the agreement became due subsequent to
the handing over of the post-dated cheque. Thus, contended the Appellant, it was not
towards discharge of debt or liability in praesenti but for the amount payable in future.
5. The High Court did not accept the above contention and held:
10. In the present case when the post-dated cheques were issued, the loan had
been sanctioned and hence the same fall in the first category that is they were
cheque issued for a debt in present but payable in future. Hence, I find no
reason to quash the complaints. However, these observations are only prima
facie in nature and it will be open for the party to prove to the contrary during
trial.
6. We have heard learned Counsel for the parties.
7 . It will be appropriate to reproduce the statutory provision in question which is as
follows:
1 3 8 . Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the
account.-Where any cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by
him with a banker for payment of any amount of money to another person from
out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other
liability, is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount of money
standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that
it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement
made with that bank, such person shall be deemed to have committed an
offence and shall, without prejudice to any other provisions of this Act, be
punished with imprisonment for a term which may be extended to two years, or
with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both:
Provided that nothing contained in this Section shall apply unless-
(a) the cheque has been presented to the bank within a period
of six months from the date on which it is drawn or within the
period of its validity, whichever is earlier;
(b) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as the
case may be, makes a demand for the payment of the said
amount of money by giving a notice in writing, to the drawer of
the cheque, within thirty days of the receipt of information by
him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as
unpaid; and
(c) the drawer of such cheque fails to make the payment of the
said amount of money to the payee or, as the case may be, to
the holder in due course of the cheque, within fifteen days of
the receipt of the said notice.
Explanation.-For the purposes of this section, ""debt or other liability""
means a legally enforceable debt or other liability.
8. Clause 3.1(iii) of the agreement may also be noted:
3.1 SECURITY FOR THE LOAN
The loan together with the interest, interest tax, liquidated damages,
commitment fee, up front fee prima on repayment or on redemption, costs,
expenses and other monies shall be secured by;
(i) xxxxx
(ii) xxxxx
(iii) Deposit of Post dated cheques towards repayment of installments
of principal of loan amount in accordance with agreed repayment
Schedule and installments of interest payable thereon.
9. Reference may now be made to the decision of this Court in Indus Airways Private
Limited v. Magnum Aviation Private Limited MANU/SC/0288/2014 : (2014) 12 SCC
539, on which strong reliance has been placed by learned Counsel for the Appellant.
The question therein was whether post-dated cheque issued by way of advance payment
for a purchase order could be considered for discharge of legally enforceable debt. The
cheque was issued by way of advance payment for the purchase order but the purchase
order was cancelled and payment of the cheque was stopped. This Court held that while
the purchaser may be liable for breach of the contract, when a contract provides that
the purchaser has to pay in advance and cheque towards advance payment is
dishonoured, it will not give rise to criminal liability Under Section 138 of the Act.
Issuance of cheque towards advance payment could not be considered as discharge of
any subsisting liability. View to this effect of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Swastik
Coaters (P) Ltd. v. Deepak Bros. (1997) Crl. L J 1942 (AP), Madras High Court in
Balaji Seafoods Exports (India) Ltd. v. Mac Industries Ltd. (1999) 1 CTC 6 (Mad),
Gujarat High Court in Shanku Concretes (P) Ltd. v. State of Gujarat (2000) Crl L J
1988 (Guj) and Kerala High Court in Supply House v. Ullas (2006) Crl. L J 4330 (Ker)
was held to be correct view as against the view of Delhi High Court in Magnum Aviation
(P) Ltd. v. State (2010) 172 DLT 91 : (2010) 118 DRJ 505 and Mojj Engg. Systems
Ltd. v. A.B. Sugars Ltd. (2008) 154 DLT 579 which was disapproved.
1 0 . We have given due consideration to the submission advanced on behalf of the
Appellant as well as the observations of this Court in Indus Airways (supra) with
reference to the explanation to Section 138 of the Act and the expression ""for discharge
of any debt or other liability"" occurring in Section 138 of the Act. We are of the view
that the question whether a post-dated cheque is for ""discharge of debt or liability""
depends on the nature of the transaction. If on the date of the cheque liability or debt
exists or the amount has become legally recoverable, the Section is attracted and not
otherwise.
1 1 . Reference to the facts of the present case clearly shows that though the word
""security"" is used in Clause 3.1(iii) of the agreement, the said expression refers to the
cheques being towards repayment of installments. The repayment becomes due under
the agreement, the moment the loan is advanced and the installment falls due. It is
undisputed that the loan was duly disbursed on 28th February, 2002 which was prior to
the date of the cheques. Once the loan was disbursed and installments have fallen due
on the date of the cheque as per the agreement, dishonour of such cheques would fall
Under Section 138 of the Act. The cheques undoubtedly represent the outstanding
liability.
12. Judgment in Indus Airways (supra) is clearly distinguishable. As already noted, it
was held therein that liability arising out of claim for breach of contract Under Section
138, which arises on account of dishonour of cheque issued was not by itself at par
with criminal liability towards discharge of acknowledged and admitted debt under a
loan transaction. Dishonour of cheque issued for discharge of later liability is clearly
covered by the statute in question. Admittedly, on the date of the cheque there was a
debt/liability in praesenti in terms of the loan agreement, as against the case of Indus
Airways (supra) where the purchase order had been cancelled and cheque issued
towards advance payment for the purchase order was dishonoured. In that case, it was
found that the cheque had not been issued for discharge of liability but as advance for
the purchase order which was cancelled. Keeping in mind this fine but real distinction,
the said judgment cannot be applied to a case of present nature where the cheque was
for repayment of loan installment which had fallen due though such deposit of cheques
towards repayment of installments was also described as ""security"" in the loan
agreement. In applying the judgment in Indus Airways (supra), one cannot lose sight
of the difference between a transaction of purchase order which is cancelled and that of
a loan transaction where loan has actually been advanced and its repayment is due on
the date of the cheque.
13. Crucial question to determine applicability of Section 138 of the Act is whether the
cheque represents discharge of existing enforceable debt or liability or whether it
represents advance payment without there being subsisting debt or liability. While
approving the views of different High Courts noted earlier, this is the underlying
principle as can be discerned from discussion of the said cases in the judgment of this
Court.
14. In Balaji Seafoods (supra), the High Court noted that the cheque was not handed
over with the intention of discharging the subsisting liability or debt. There is, thus, no
similarity in the facts of that case simply because in that case also loan was advanced.
It was noticed specifically therein-as was the admitted case of the parties-that the
cheque was issued as ""security"" for the advance and was not intended to be in
discharge of the liability, as in the present case.
15. In HMT Watches Ltd. v. M.A. Abida MANU/SC/0296/2015 : (2015) 11 SCC 776,
relied upon on behalf of the Respondent, this Court dealt with the contention that the
proceedings Under Section 138 were liable to be quashed as the cheques were given as
""security"" as per defence of the accused. Negativing the contention, this Court held:
10. Having heard the learned Counsel for the parties, we are of the view that
the accused (Respondent 1) challenged the proceedings of criminal complaint
cases before the High Court, taking factual defences. Whether the cheques were
given as security or not, or whether there was outstanding liability or not is a
question of fact which could have been determined only by the trial court after
recording evidence of the parties. In our opinion, the High Court should not
have expressed its view on the disputed questions of fact in a petition Under
Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to come to a conclusion that the
offence is not made out. The High Court has erred in law in going into the
factual aspects of the matter which were not admitted between the parties. The
High Court further erred in observing that Section 138(b) of the NI Act stood
uncomplied with, even though Respondent 1 (accused) had admitted that he
replied to the notice issued by the complainant. Also, the fact, as to whether the
signatory of demand notice was authorised by the complainant company or not,
could not have been examined by the High Court in its jurisdiction Under Section
482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when such plea was controverted by the
complainant before it.
11. In Suryalakshmi Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Rajvir Industries Ltd.
[MANU/SC/7050/2008 : (2008) 13 SCC 678], this Court has made the following
observations explaining the parameters of jurisdiction of the High Court in
exercising its jurisdiction Under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure:
(SCC pp. 685-87, paras 17 & 22)
17. The parameters of jurisdiction of the High Court in exercising its
jurisdiction Under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is now
well settled. Although it is of wide amplitude, a great deal of caution is
also required in its exercise. What is required is application of the wellknown
legal principles involved in the matter.
***
22. Ordinarily, a defence of an accused although appears to be plausible
should not be taken into consideration for exercise of the said
jurisdiction. Yet again, the High Court at that stage would not ordinarily
enter into a disputed question of fact. It, however, does not mean that
documents of unimpeachable character should not be taken into
consideration at any cost for the purpose of finding out as to whether
continuance of the criminal proceedings would amount to an abuse of
process of court or that the complaint petition is filed for causing mere
harassment to the accused. While we are not oblivious of the fact that
although a large number of disputes should ordinarily be determined
only by the civil courts, but criminal cases are filed only for achieving
the ultimate goal, namely, to force the accused to pay the amount due
to the complainant immediately. The courts on the one hand should not
encourage such a practice; but, on the other, cannot also travel beyond
its jurisdiction to interfere with the proceeding which is otherwise
genuine. The courts cannot also lose sight of the fact that in certain
matters, both civil proceedings and criminal proceedings would be
maintainable.
12. In Rallis India Ltd. v. Poduru Vidya Bhushan [MANU/SC/0422/2011 : (2011)
13 SCC 88], this Court expressed its views on this point as under: (SCC p. 93,
para 12)
12. At the threshold, the High Court should not have interfered with the
cognizance of the complaints having been taken by the trial court. The
High Court could not have discharged the Respondents of the said
liability at the threshold. Unless the parties are given opportunity to lead
evidence, it is not possible to come to a definite conclusion as to what
was the date when the earlier partnership was dissolved and since what
date the Respondents ceased to be the partners of the firm.
16. We are in respectful agreement with the above observations. In the present case,
reference to the complaint (a copy of which is Annexures P-7) shows that as per the
case of the complainant, the cheques which were subject matter of the said complaint
were towards the partial repayment of the dues under the loan agreement (para 5 of the
complaint).
17. As is clear from the above observations of this Court, it is well settled that while
dealing with a quashing petition, the Court has ordinarily to proceed on the basis of
averments in the complaint. The defence of the accused cannot be considered at this
stage. The court considering the prayer for quashing does not adjudicate upon a
disputed question of fact.
18. In Rangappa v. Sri Mohan MANU/SC/0376/2010 : (2010) 11 SCC 441, this Court
held that once issuance of a cheque and signature thereon are admitted, presumption of
a legally enforceable debt in favour of the holder of the cheque arises. It is for the
accused to rebut the said presumption, though accused need not adduce his own
evidence and can rely upon the material submitted by the complainant. However, mere
statement of the accused may not be sufficient to rebut the said presumption. A post
dated cheque is a well recognized mode of payment1.
19. Thus, the question has to be answered in favour of the Respondent and against the
Appellant. Dishonour of cheque in the present case being for discharge of existing
liability is covered by Section 138 of the Act, as rightly held by the High Court.
20. Accordingly, we do not find any merit in this appeal and the same is dismissed.
Since we have only gone into the question whether on admitted facts, case for quashing
has not been made out, the Appellant will be at liberty to contest the matter in trial
court in accordance with law.","Appellants: Sampelly Satyanarayana Rao

Case Category:
CRIMINAL MATTERS - MATTERS CHALLENGING PROSECUTION UNDER NEGOTIABLE
INSTRUMENTS ACT
Facts:
The Appellant was Director of the company whose cheques have been
dishonoured and who was also the co-accused. Vide the loan agreement, the
Respondent agreed to advance loan for setting up of Power Project in the
State. The agreement recorded that post-dated cheques towards payment of
installment of loan (principal and interest) were given by way of security. The
cheques carried different dates depending on the dates when the installments
were due and upon dishonour thereof, complaints including the one were filed
by the Respondent in the Court. The Appellant approached the High Court to
seek quashing of the complaints. Contention of the Appellant in support of his
case was that the cheques were given by way of security as mentioned in the
agreement and that on the date the cheques were issued, no debt or liability
was due. Thus, dishonour of post-dated cheques given by way of security did
not fall under Section 138 of the Act. The High Court held that when the postdated
cheques were issued, the loan had been sanctioned and hence the
same fall in the first category that was they were cheque issued for a debt in
present but payable in future and declined to quash the complaints.
Held, while dismissing the appeal:
(i) The question whether a post-dated cheque is for ""discharge of debt or
liability"" depends on the nature of the transaction. If on the date of the
cheque liability or debt exists or the amount has become legally recoverable,
the Section is attracted and not otherwise. [10]
(ii) Though the word ""security"" is used in Clause 3.1(iii) of the agreement,
the said expression refers to the cheques being towards repayment of
installments. The repayment becomes due under the agreement, the moment
the loan is advanced and the installment falls due.Once the loan was
disbursed and installments had fallen due on the date of the cheque as per
the agreement, dishonour of such cheques would fall under Section 138 of
the Act. The cheques undoubtedly represent the outstanding liability. [11]
(iii) As per the case of the Complainant, the cheques which were subject
matter of the said complaint were towards the partial repayment of the dues
under the loan agreement. While dealing with a quashing petition, the Court
has ordinarily to proceed on the basis of averments in the complaint. The
defence of the Accused cannot be considered at this stage. The Court
considering the prayer for quashing does not adjudicate upon a disputed
question of fact. [16] and[17]
(iv) The question was answered in favour of the Respondent and against the
Appellant. Dishonour of cheque in the present case being for discharge of
existing liability was covered by Section 138 of the Act, as rightly held by the
High Court. [19]",,,,

1. Leave granted.
2 . An appeal Under Section 18 of The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial
Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as
'SARFAESI Act') before the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as
'DRAT') can be entertained only if the borrower deposits fifty per cent of the amount in
terms of the order passed by the Debt Recovery Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as
'DRT') Under Section 17 of the Act or fifty per cent of the amount due from the
borrower as claimed by the secured creditor, whichever is less. The Appellate Tribunal
may reduce the amount to twenty five per cent. What is the fate of such deposit on the
disposal of the appeal is the question arising for consideration in this case.
3 . Being a pure legal issue, it may not be necessary for us to refer to the factual
position in detail. The first Respondent, being a borrower and aggrieved by the steps
taken by the secured creditor, filed Securitisation Application No. 152 of 2010 before
the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Ahmedabad. Though, initially an interim relief was granted,
the same was vacated by order dated 20.01.2011. Therefore, the first Respondent
moved the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai Under Section 18 of the
SARFAESI Act. In terms of the proviso Under Section 18, the first Respondent made a
deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs before the Appellate Tribunal. During the pendency of the appeal
before the DRAT, Securitisation Application itself came to be finally disposed of before
the Debt Recovery Tribunal at Ahmedabad, setting aside the sale. Realising that the
appeal did not survive thereafter, the first Respondent sought permission to withdraw
the same and also for refund of the deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs. Permission was granted,
however, making it subject to the disposal of the appeal. As the appeal itself was being
withdrawn, the first Respondent moved the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad by way
of Writ Petition (Special Civil Application), aggrieved by the observation that the
withdrawal would be subject to the result of the appeal. The same was disposed of by
order dated 05.03.2015 by the learned Single Judge, setting aside the said condition
and permitting the first Respondent herein to withdraw the amount unconditionally.
Aggrieved, the Appellant-Bank filed an intra-Court appeal. That appeal was dismissed
by order dated 01.04.2015 by a Division Bench, and thus aggrieved, the Bank has come
up in appeal before this Court.
4. Heard learned Senior Counsel Shri C.U. Singh appearing for the Appellant-Bank and
learned Counsel Prashant Pandit appearing for the Respondents.
5 . The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant-Bank submits that the first
Respondent has no right to get back the deposit made by it as a pre-condition for
entertaining the appeal. The said amount has to be set off against the dues of the first
Respondent, which has actually been quantified and for which, Section 13 recovery
steps have been permitted. It is submitted that the Appellant-Bank has to secure the
entire debt by proceeding against the secured assets, and therefore, the deposit is liable
to be appropriated by the Bank. Reference is also made to Section 13(10) of the
SARFAESI Act and Rule 11 of The Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002, which
read as follows:
13(10) Where dues of the secured creditor are not fully satisfied with the sale
proceeds of the secured assets, the secured creditor may file an application in
the form and manner as may be prescribed to the Debts Recovery Tribunal
having jurisdiction or a competent court, as the case may be, for recovery of
the balance amount from the borrower.
11. Procedure for Recovery of shortfall of secured debt.-(1) An
application for recovery of balance amount by any secured creditor pursuant to
Sub-section (10) of Section 13 of the Act shall be presented to the Debts
Recovery Tribunal in the form annexed as Appendix VI to these Rules by the
authorised officer or his agent or by a duly authorised legal practitioner, to the
Registrar of the Bench within whose jurisdiction his case falls or shall be sent
by registered post addressed to the Registrar of Debts Recovery Tribunal.
(2) The provisions of the Debts Recovery Tribunal (Procedure) Rules, 1993
made under Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act,
1993 (51 of 1993), shall mutatis mutandis apply to any application filed by
under Sub-rule (1).
(3) An application under Sub-rule (1) shall be accompanied with fee as
provided in Rule 7 of the Debts Recovery Tribunal (Procedure) Rules, 1993.
6 . Learned Senior Counsel further submits that the Bank has a lien on the amount
Under Section 171 of The Indian Contract Act, 1872. The decision of the High Court of
Gujarat in Babu Ganesh Singh Deepnarayan v. Union of India and Anr.
MANU/GJ/0304/2009 : AIR 2009 Guj. 98, which has been followed by the Division
Bench in the impugned judgment, does not reflect the true legal position, it is further
submitted.
7. Babu Ganesh (supra) was a case involving a challenge on the vires of the second
proviso Under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act, on the mandatory pre-deposit. While
upholding the provision, at paragraphs-5 and 6, it was observed that, in case the appeal
is dismissed, the amounts deposited for entertaining the appeal would be refunded. To
quote:
5.Right of appeal is a creature of the statute. Legislature can impose conditions
under which it is to be exercised. Without a statutory provision creating such a
right, a person aggrieved is not entitled to prefer an appeal. Legislature while
granting right of appeal can impose conditions which it thinks reasonable. Such
conditions merely regulate the exercise of right of appeal so that the same is
not abused by a recalcitrant party, and there is no difficulty in the enforcement
of the order appealed against in case the appeal is ultimately dismissed.
Imposition of such a condition is essential, so that frivolous appeals would not
be filed. Ultimately if the appeal is dismissed, the aggrieved party can always
seek refund of the amount deposited and therefore, he is not in any way
aggrieved. Further the Third Proviso to Section 18(1) of the Securitization Act
also enables the Appellate Tribunal, for the reasons to be recorded in writing,
reduce the amount to not less than 25% of the debt referred to in the Second
Proviso. We are not prepared to accept the contention that conditions imposed
in the second and third proviso to Section 18(1) of the Securitization Act are
onerous in nature so as to make the right of appeal illusory. Delhi High Court in
R.V. Saxena's case (supra) also upheld the validity of Second Proviso to Section
18(1) of the Securitization Act with which we fully concur.
6. We have also not come across any provision in the Statute, enabling the
secured creditor to adjust or appropriate the amount deposited by the borrower
to prefer an appeal Under Section 18(1) of the Act. On dismissal of the appeal
the amount deposited as a pre-condition for filing the appeal will be refunded
to the Appellant and therefore, he is no way prejudiced. We therefore, find no
merit in the contention raised by the Petitioner that the second proviso to
Section 18(1) of the Act is discriminatory or violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution of India. Petitions lack merit and the same are dismissed.
8. At this juncture, it may be necessary to refer to the scheme of the SARFAESI Act. The
Act was intended to facilitate easy and faster recovery of loans advanced by banks and
financial institutions. The ordinary recovery mechanism contemplated in The Code of
Civil Procedure, 1908 was not considered sufficient. Thus, the Recovery of Debts Due to
Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 was introduced for a special and speedier
mechanism for the recovery. Almost a decade of experience proved that the recovery
process was not achieving the intended objects and hence, the SARFAESI Act to
regulate securitisation and reconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of security
interest was enacted. The Act incorporates a system whereby direct action for recovery
of secured debt may be initiated against the secured assets of a borrower after the debt
is declared to be a non performing asset (NPA).
9. ""Borrower"" is defined Under Section 2(1)(f), which reads as follows:
2(1)(f) ""borrower"" means any person who has been granted financial
assistance by any bank or financial institution or who has given any
guarantee or created any mortgage or pledge as security for the
financial assistance granted by any bank or financial institution and
includes a person who becomes borrower of a securitisation company
or reconstruction company consequent upon acquisition by it of any
rights or interest of any bank or financial institution in relation to such
financial assistance;
10. ""Secured Asset"", Under Section 2(1)(zc), is defined as:
2(1)(zc) ""secured asset"" means the property on which the security
interest is created
1 1 . ""Section 2(1)(zd) provides for definition of ""secured creditor"", which reads as
follows:
2(1)(zd) ""secured creditor"" means any bank or financial institution or
any consortium or group of banks or financial institutions and
includes--
(i) debenture trustee appointed by any bank or financial
institution; or
(ii) securitisation company or reconstruction company, whether
acting as such or managing a trust set up by such securitisation
company or reconstruction company for the securitisation or
reconstruction, as the case may be; or any other trustee
holding securities on behalf of a bank or financial institution,
in whose favour security interest is created for due repayment
by any borrower of any financial assistance;
12. Section 2(1)(ze) defines ""secured debt"" to mean ""a debt which is secured by
any security interest"".
13. ""Security interest"" is defined Under Section 2(1)(zf):
(zf) ""security interest"" means right, title and interest of any kind
whatsoever upon property, created in favour of any secured creditor
and includes any mortgage, charge, hypothecation, assignment other
than those specified in Section 31;
14. The mechanism for enforcement of security interest is contemplated Under Section
13 of the Act. Sub-sections (1), (2), (3), (3A) and (4) of Section 13 are relevant for the
purposes of the present case and they are extracted below:
13. Enforcement of security interest
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 69 or Section 69A of the
Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882), any security interest created in
favour of any secured creditor may be enforced, without the intervention of
court or tribunal, by such creditor in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
(2) Where any borrower, who is under a liability to a secured creditor under a
security agreement, makes any default in repayment of secured debt or any
installment thereof, and his account in respect of such debt is classified by the
secured creditor as non-performing asset, then, the secured creditor may
require the borrower by notice in writing to discharge in full his liabilities to the
secured creditor within sixty days from the date of notice failing which the
secured creditor shall be entitled to exercise all or any of the rights under Subsection
(4).
(3) The notice referred to in Sub-section (2) shall give details of the amount
payable by the borrower and the secured assets intended to be enforced by the
secured creditor in the event of non-payment of secured debts by the borrower.
(3A) If, on receipt of the notice under Sub-section (2), the borrower makes any
representation or raises any objection, the secured creditor shall consider such
representation or objection and if the secured creditor comes to the conclusion
that such representation or objection is not acceptable or tenable, he shall
communicate within one week of receipt of such representation or objection the
reasons for non-acceptance of the representation or objection to the borrower:
Provided that the reasons so communicated or the likely action of the
secured creditor at the stage of communication of reasons shall not
confer any right upon the borrower to prefer an application to the
Debts Recovery Tribunal Under Section 17 or the Court of District
Judge Under Section 17A.
(4) In case the borrower fails to discharge his liability in full within the period
specified in Sub-section (2), the secured creditor may take recourse to one or
more of the following measures to recover his secured debt, namely:-
(a) take possession of the secured assets of the borrower including the
right to transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale for realising the
secured asset;
(b) take over the management of the business of the borrower
including the right to transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale for
realising the secured asset:
Provided that the right to transfer by way of lease, assignment
or sale shall be exercised only where the substantial part of the
business of the borrower is held as security for the debt.
Provided further that where the management of whole of the
business or part of the business is severable, the secured
creditor shall take over the management of such business of
the borrower which is relatable to the security for the debt.
(c) appoint any person (hereafter referred to as the manager), to
manage the secured assets the possession of which has been taken
over by the secured creditor;
(d) require at any time by notice in writing, any person who has
acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower and from whom
any money is due or may become due to the borrower, to pay the
secured creditor, so much of the money as is sufficient to pay the
secured debt.
1 5 . A conspectus of the aforesaid provisions shows that under the scheme of the
SARFAESI Act, a secured creditor is entitled to proceed against the borrower for the
purpose of recovering his secured debt by taking action against the secured assets, in
case the borrower fails to discharge his liability in full within the period specified in the
notice issued Under Section 13(2) of the Act. It is the mandate of Section 13(3) of the
Act that the notice issued Under Section 13(2) should contain details of the amount
payable by the borrower and also the secured assets intended to be enforced by the
secured creditor in the event of non-payment of the dues as per Section 13(2) notice.
Thus, the secured creditor is entitled to proceed only against the secured assets
mentioned in the notice Under Section 13(2). However, in terms of Section 13(11) of
the Act, the secured creditor is also free to proceed first against the guarantors or sell
the pledged assets. To quote:
13(11) Without prejudice to the rights conferred on the secured creditor under
or by this section, the secured creditor shall be entitled to proceed against the
guarantors or sell the pledged assets without first taking any of the measures
specified in Clauses (a) to (d) of Sub-section (4) in relation to the secured
assets under this Act.
16. Section 17 of the Act provides for a right to appeal to the DRT in respect of the
grievances on the measures taken by the secured creditor Under Section 13 of the Act.
To quote for easy reference, Section 17 of the Act:
17. Right to appeal.-(1) Any person (including borrower), aggrieved by any
of the measures referred to in Sub-section (4) of Section 13 taken by the
secured creditor or his authorised officer under this Chapter, may make an
application alongwith such fee, as may be prescribed to the Debts Recovery
Tribunal having jurisdiction in the matter within forty-five days from the date
on which such measure had been taken:
Provided that different fees may be prescribed for making the
application by the borrower and the person other than the borrower.
Explanation: For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that the
communication of the reasons to the borrower by the secured creditor for not
having accepted his representation or objection or the likely action of the
secured creditor at the stage of communication of reasons to the borrower shall
not entitle the person (including borrower) to make an application to the Debts
Recovery Tribunal under Sub-section (1).
(2) The Debts Recovery Tribunal shall consider whether any of the measures
referred to in Sub-section (4) of Section 13 taken by the secured creditor for
enforcement of security are in accordance with the provisions of this Act and
the Rules made thereunder.
(3) If, the Debts Recovery Tribunal, after examining the facts and circumstances
of the case and evidence produced by the parties, comes to the conclusion that
any of the measures referred to in Sub-section (4) of Section 13, taken by the
secured creditor are not in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the
Rules made thereunder, and require restoration of the management of the
business to the borrower or restoration of possession of the secured assets to
the borrower, it may by order, declare the recourse to any one or more
measures referred to in Sub-section (4) of Section 13 taken by the secured
creditors as invalid and restore the possession of the secured assets to the
borrower or restore the management of the business to the borrower, as the
case may be, and pass such order as it may consider appropriate and necessary
in relation to any of the recourse taken by the secured creditor under Subsection
(4) of Section 13.
(4) If, the Debts Recovery Tribunal declares the recourse taken by a secured
creditor under Sub-section (4) of Section 13, is in accordance with the
provisions of this Act and the Rules made thereunder, then, notwithstanding
anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the secured
creditor shall be entitled to take recourse to one or more of the measures
specified under Sub-section (4) of Section 13 to recover his secured debt.
(5) Any application made under Sub-section (1) shall be dealt with by the
Debts Recovery Tribunal as expeditiously as possible and disposed of within
sixty days from the date of such application:
Provided that the Debts Recovery Tribunal may, from time to time,
extend the said period for reasons to be recorded in writing, so,
however, that the total period of pendency of the application with the
Debts Recovery Tribunal, shall not exceed four months from the date of
making of such application made under Sub-section (1).
(6) If the application is not disposed of by the Debts Recovery Tribunal within
the period of four months as specified in Sub-section (5), any party to the
application may make an application, in such form as may be prescribed, to the
Appellate Tribunal for directing the Debts Recovery Tribunal for expeditious
disposal of the application pending before the Debts Recovery Tribunal and the
Appellate Tribunal may, on such application, make an order for expeditious
disposal of the pending application by the Debts Recovery Tribunal.
(7) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the Debts Recovery Tribunal shall,
as far as may be, dispose of the application in accordance with the provisions
of the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 and
the Rules made thereunder.
17. Though Section 17 of the Act is titled as a 'Right to appeal', the liberty granted to
the aggrieved person is to make an application to the DRT and the parties are at a
liberty to lead evidence before the tribunal. And thus, it is actually a trial before the
DRT on the grievances of the aggrieved persons in the respect of the measures taken by
the secured creditor for recovery of dues of the borrower in proceeding against the
secured assets. (See Mardia Chemicals v. Union of India MANU/SC/0323/2004 :
(2004) 4 SCC 311)
1 8 . The actual appeal is contemplated Under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act. The
provision reads as follows:
18. Appeal to Appellate Tribunal.-(1) Any person aggrieved, by any order
made by the Debts Recovery Tribunal Under Section 17, may prefer an appeal
alongwith such fee, as may be prescribed to the Appellate Tribunal within thirty
days from the date of receipt of the order of Debts Recovery Tribunal:
Provided that different fees may be prescribed for filing an appeal by
the borrower or by the person other than the borrower:
Provided further that no appeal shall be entertained unless the
borrower has deposited with the Appellate Tribunal fifty per
cent of the amount of debt due from him, as claimed by the
secured creditors or determined by the Debts Recovery
Tribunal, whichever is less:
Provided also that the Appellate Tribunal may, for the reasons
to be recorded in writing, reduce the amount to not less than
twenty-five per cent. of debt referred to in the second proviso.
(2) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the Appellate Tribunal shall, as far
as may be, dispose of the appeal in accordance with the provisions of the
Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (51 of
1993) and Rules made thereunder.
19. Any person aggrieved by the order of the DRT Under Section 17 of the SARFAESI
Act, is entitled to prefer an appeal along with the prescribed fee within the permitted
period of 30 days. For 'preferring' an appeal, a fee is prescribed, whereas for the
Tribunal to 'entertain' the appeal, the aggrieved person has to make a deposit of fifty
per cent of the amount of debt due from him as claimed by the secured creditors or
determined by the DRT, whichever is less. This amount can, at the discretion of the
Tribunal, in appropriate cases, for recorded reasons, be reduced to twenty- five per cent
of the debt.
2 0 . This Court, in Lakshmi Rattan Engineering Works Limited v. Assistant
Commissioner Sales Tax, Kanpur and Anr. MANU/SC/0309/1967 : AIR 1968 SC
488, had the occasion to consider the meaning of the expression 'entertain' in the
context of a similar provision in the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act, 1948 where it was held
that in such context, the expression has the meaning of ""admitting to consideration"".
The relevant discussion is available at paragraphs-9 and 10:
9. The word 'entertain' is explained by a Divisional Bench of the Allahabad High
Court as denoting the point of time at which an application to set aside the sale
is heard by the court. The expression 'entertain', it is stated, does not mean the
same thing as the filing of the application or admission of the application by the
court. A similar view was again taken in Dhoom Chand Jain v. Chamanlal Gupta
and Anr. MANU/UP/0132/1962 : AIR 1962 All. 543, in which the learned Chief
Justice Desai and Mr. Justice Dwivedi gave the same meaning to the expression
'entertain'. It is observed by Dwivedi J. that the word 'entertain' in its
application bears the meaning 'admitting to consideration', and therefore when
the court cannot refuse to take an application which is backed by deposit or
security, it cannot refuse judicially to consider it. In a single bench decision of
the same court reported in Bawan Ram and Anr. v. Kuni Beharilal A.I.R. 1961
All. 42, one of us (Bhargava, J.) had to consider the same rule. There the
deposit had not been made within the period of limitation and the question had
arisen whether the court could entertain the application or not. It was decided
that the application could not be entertained because proviso (b) debarred the
court from entertaining an objection unless the requirement of depositing the
amount or furnishing security was complied with within the time prescribed. In
that case of the word 'entertain' is not interpreted but it is held that the court
cannot proceed to consider the application in the absence of deposit made
within the time allowed by law. This case turned on the fact that the deposit
was made out of time. In yet another case of the Allahabad High Court reported
in Haji Rahim Bux and Sons and Ors. v. Firm Samiullah and Sons
MANU/UP/0091/1963 : A.I.R. 1963 All. 326, a division bench consisting of
Chief Justice Desai and Mr. Justice S.D. Singh interpreted the words of Order
21, Rule 90, by saying that the word 'entertain' meant not 'receive' or 'accept'
but proceed to consider on merits' or 'adjudicate upon'.
10. In our opinion these cases have taken a correct view of the word 'entertain'
which according to dictionary also means 'admit to consideration'. It would
therefore appear that the direction to the court in the proviso to Section 9 is
that the court shall not proceed to admit to consideration an appeal which is
not accompanied by satisfactory proof of the payment of the admitted tax. This
will be when the case is taken up by the court for the first time. In the decision
on which the Assistant Commissioner relied, the learned Chief Justice (Desai
C.J.) holds that the words 'accompanied by' showed that something tangible
had to accompany the memorandum of appeal. If the memorandum of appeal
had to be accompanied by satisfactory proof, it had to be in the shape of
something tangible, because no intangible thing can accompany a document
like the memorandum of appeal. In our opinion, making 'an appeal' the
equivalent of the memorandum of appeal is not sound. Even under Order 41 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, the expression ""appeal"" and ""memorandum of
appeal"" are used to distinct two distinct things. In Wharton's Law Lexicon, the
word ""appeal"" is defined as the judicial examination of the decision by a higher
Court of the decision of an inferior court. The appeal is the judicial
examination; the memorandum of appeal contains the grounds on which the
judicial examination is invited. For purposes of limitation and for purposes of
the Rules of the Court it is required that a written memorandum of appeal shall
be filed. When the proviso speaks of the entertainment of the appeal, it means
that the appeal such as was filed will not be admitted to consideration unless
there is satisfactory proof available of the making of the deposit of admitted
tax.
21. We are also conscious of the fact that such a precondition is present in several
statutes while providing for statutory appeals, like The Income-Tax Act, 1961, The
Central Excise Act, 1944, The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, The Motor Vehicles Act,
1988, etc. However, unlike those statutes, the purpose of the SARFAESI Act is different,
it is meant only for speedy recovery of the dues, and the scheme Under Section 13(4)
of the Act, permits the secured creditor to proceed only against the secured assets. of
course, the secured creditor is free to proceed against the guarantors and the pledged
assets, notwithstanding the steps Under Section 13(4) and without first exhausting the
recovery as against secured assets referred to in the notice Under Section 13(2). But
such guarantor, if aggrieved, is not entitled to approach DRT Under Section 17. That
right is restricted only to persons aggrieved by steps Under Section 13(4) proceeding
for recovery against the secured assets.
22. The Appeal Under Section 18 of the Act is permissible only against the order passed
by the DRT Under Section 17 of the Act. Under Section 17, the scope of enquiry is
limited to the steps taken Under Section 13(4) against the secured assets. The partial
deposit before the DRAT as a pre-condition for considering the appeal on merits in
terms of Section 18 of the Act, is not a secured asset. It is not a secured debt either,
since the borrower or the aggrieved person has not created any security interest on
such pre-deposit in favour of the secured creditor. If that be so, on disposal of the
appeal, either on merits or on withdrawal, or on being rendered infructuous, in case,
the Appellant makes a prayer for refund of the pre-deposit, the same has to be allowed
and the pre-deposit has to be returned to the Appellant, unless the Appellate Tribunal,
on the request of the secured creditor but with the consent of the depositors, had
already appropriated the pre-deposit towards the liability of the borrower, or with the
consent, had adjusted the amount towards the dues, or if there be any attachment on
the pre-deposit in any proceedings Under Section 13(10) of the Act read with Rule 11 of
The Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002, or if there be any attachment in any
other proceedings known to law.
23. We are also unable to agree with the contention that the Bank has a lien on the predeposit
made Under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act in terms of Section 171 of The
Indian Contract Act, 1872. Section 171 of The Indian Contract Act, 1872 on general lien,
is in a different context:
171. General lien of bankers, factors, wharfingers, attorneys and
policy-brokers.--Bankers, factors, wharfingers, attorneys of a High Court and
policy-brokers may, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, retain as a
security for a general balance of account, any goods bailed to them; but no
other persons have a right to retain, as a security for such balance, goods
bailed to them, unless there is an express contract to that effect.
24. Section 171 of The Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides for retention of the goods
bailed to the bank by way of security for the general balance of account. The predeposit
made by a borrower for the purpose of entertaining the appeal Under Section 18
of the Act is not with the bank but with the Tribunal. It is not a bailment with the bank
as provided Under Section 148 of The Indian Contract Act, 1872. Conceptually, it should
be an argument available to the depositor, since the goods bailed are to be returned or
otherwise disposed of, after the purpose is accomplished as per the directions of the
bailor.
25. In the case before us, the first Respondent had in fact sought withdrawal of the
appeal, since the Appellant had already proceeded against the secured assets by the
time the appeal came up for consideration on merits. There is neither any order of
appropriation during the pendency of the appeal nor any attachment on the pre-deposit.
Therefore, the deposit made by the first Respondent is liable to be returned to the first
Respondent.
26. Though for different reasons as well, we endorse the view taken by the High Court.
Thus, there is no merit in the appeal. It is accordingly dismissed.
27. We make it clear that the dismissal of the appeal is without prejudice to the liberty
available to the Appellant to take appropriate steps Under Section 13(10) of the
SARFAESI Act read with Rule 11 of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002.

Facts:
The first Respondent, being a borrower and aggrieved by the steps taken by
the secured creditor, filed Securitisation Application before the Debt Recovery
Tribunal, Ahmedabad. Though, initially an interim relief was granted, the
same was vacated by order. Therefore, the first Respondent moved the Debt
Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai Under Section 18 of the SARFAESI Act.
In terms of the proviso Under Section 18, the first Respondent made a deposit
of Rs. 50 lakhs before the Appellate Tribunal. During the pendency of the
appeal before the DRAT, Securitisation Application itself came to be finally
disposed of before the Debt Recovery Tribunal at Ahmedabad, setting aside
the sale. Realising that the appeal did not survive thereafter, the first
Respondent sought permission to withdraw the same and also for refund of
the deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs. Permission was granted, however, making it
subject to the disposal of the appeal. As the appeal itself was being
withdrawn, the first Respondent moved the High Court of Gujarat at
Ahmedabad by way of Writ Petition (Special Civil Application), aggrieved by
the observation that the withdrawal would be subject to the result of the
appeal. The same was disposed of by the learned Single Judge, setting aside
the said condition and permitting the first Respondent herein to withdraw the
amount unconditionally. Aggrieved, the Appellant-Bank filed an intra-Court
appeal. That appeal was dismissed by a Division Bench, and thus aggrieved,
the Bank has come up in appeal before this Court.
Held, while dismissing the Appeal
(1) The first Respondent, being a borrower and aggrieved by the steps taken
by the secured creditor, filed Securitisation Application No. 152 of 2010
before the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Ahmedabad. Though, initially an interim
relief was granted, the same was vacated by order dated 20.01.2011.
Therefore, the first Respondent moved the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal,
Mumbai Under Section18of the SARFAESI Act.[22]
(2) In terms of the proviso Under Section 18, the first Respondent made a
deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs before the Appellate Tribunal. During the pendency of
the appeal before the DRAT, Securitisation Application itself came to be
finally disposed of before the Debt Recovery Tribunal at Ahmedabad, setting
aside the sale. Realising that the appeal did not survive thereafter, the first
Respondent sought permission to withdraw the same and also for refund of
the deposit of Rs. 50 lakhs. Permission was granted, however, making it
subject to the disposal of the appeal. As the appeal itself was being
withdrawn, the first Respondent moved the High Court of Gujarat at
Ahmedabad by way of Writ Petition (Special Civil Application), aggrieved by
the observation that the withdrawal would be subject to the result of the
appeal. The same was disposed of by order dated 05.03.2015 by the learned
Single Judge, setting aside the said condition and permitting the first
Respondent herein to withdraw the amount unconditionally. Aggrieved, the
Appellant-Bank filed an intra-Court appeal. That appeal was dismissed by
order dated 01.04.2015 by a Division Bench, and thus aggrieved, the Bank has
come up in appeal before this Court.[22]
(3) We are also unable to agree with the contention that the Bank has a lien
on the pre-deposit made Under Section 18of the SARFAESI Act in terms of
Section 171of The Indian Contract Act, 1872.[23]
(4) Section 171of The Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides for retention of the
goods bailed to the bank by way of security for the general balance of
account. The pre-deposit made by a borrower for the purpose of entertaining
the appeal Under Section 18 of the Act is not with the bank but with the
Tribunal. It is not a bailment with the bank as provided Under Section 148of
The Indian Contract Act, 1872. Conceptually, it should be an argument

1. Leave granted. These appeals have been preferred against the order dated 21st April,
2017 of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in CRLM Nos. 13631,
13628 and 13630 of 2017. The High Court rejected the prayer of the Appellants for
compounding the offence Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881
(the Act) on payment of the cheque amount and in the alternative for exemption from
personal appearance.
2. When the matters came up for hearing before this Court earlier, notice was issued to
consider the question ""as to how proceedings for an offence Under Section 138 of the
Act can be regulated where the Accused is willing to deposit the cheque amount.
Whether in such a case, the proceedings can be closed or exemption granted from
personal appearance or any other order can be passed."" The Court also appointed Mr.
K.V. Viswanathan, learned senior Counsel to assist the Court as amicus and Mr. Rishi
Malhotra, learned Counsel to assist the amicus. Accordingly, learned amicus has made
his submissions and also filed written submissions duly assisted by S/Shri Rishi
Malhotra, Ravi Raghunath, Dhananjay Ray and Sidhant Buxy, advocates. We place on
record our appreciation for the services rendered by learned amicus and his team.
3 . Few Facts: The Respondent Kanchan Mehta filed complaint dated 15th July, 2016
alleging that the Appellants were to pay a monthly amount to her under an agreement.
Cheque dated 31st March, 2016 was given for Rs. 29,319/- in discharge of legal liability
but the same was returned unpaid for want of sufficient funds. In spite of service of
legal notice, the amount having not been paid, the Appellants committed the offence
Under Section 138 of the Act. The Magistrate vide order dated 24th August, 2016, after
considering the complaint and the preliminary evidence, summoned the Appellants. The
Magistrate in the order dated 9th November, 2016 observed that the case could not be
tried summarily as sentence of more than one year may have to be passed and be tried
as summons case. Notice of accusation dated 9th November, 2016 was served Under
Section 251 Code of Criminal Procedure
4 . Appellant No. 2, who is the Director of Appellant No. 1, made a statement that he
was ready to make the payment of the cheque amount. However, the complainant
declined to accept the demand draft. The case was adjourned for evidence. The
Appellants filed an application Under Section 147 of the Act on 12th January, 2017
relying upon the judgment of this Court in Damodar S. Prabhu v. Sayed Babalal H.
MANU/SC/0319/2010 : (2010) 5 SCC 663. The application was dismissed in view of the
judgment of this Court in JIK Industries Ltd. v. Amarlal V. Jumani
MANU/SC/0075/2012 : (2012) 3 SCC 255 which required consent of the complainant for
compounding. The High Court did not find any ground to interfere with the order of the
Magistrate. Facts of other two cases are identical. Hence these appeals.
5 . We have heard learned Counsel for the parties and learned amicus who has been
duly and ably assisted by S/Shri Rishi Malhotra, Ravi Raghunath, Dhananjay Ray and
Sidhant Buxy, advocates. We proceed to consider the question.
6. The object of introducing Section 138 and other provisions of Chapter XVII in the Act
in the year 19881 was to enhance the acceptability of cheques in the settlement of
liabilities. The drawer of cheque is made liable to prosecution on dishonour of cheque
with safeguards to prevent harassment of honest drawers. The Negotiable Instruments
(Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002 to amend the Act was brought in,
inter-alia, to simplify the procedure to deal with such matters. The amendment includes
provision for service of summons by Speed Post/Courier, summary trial and making the
offence compoundable.
7 . This Court has noted that the object of the statute was to facilitate smooth
functioning of business transactions. The provision is necessary as in many transactions
cheques were issued merely as a device to defraud the creditors. Dishonour of cheque
causes incalculable loss, injury and inconvenience to the payee and credibility of
business transactions suffers a setback2. At the same time, it was also noted that nature
of offence Under Section 138 primarily related to a civil wrong and the 2002
amendment specifically made it compoundable3. The offence was also described as
'regulatory offence'. The burden of proof was on the Accused in view of presumption
Under Section 139 and the standard of proof was of ""preponderance of probabilities""4.
The object of the provision was described as both punitive as well as compensatory.
The intention of the provision was to ensure that the complainant received the amount
of cheque by way of compensation. Though proceedings Under Section 138 could not
be treated as civil suits for recovery, the scheme of the provision, providing for
punishment with imprisonment or with fine which could extend to twice the amount of
the cheque or to the both, made the intention of law clear. The complainant could be
given not only the cheque amount but double the amount so as to cover interest and
costs. Section 357(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for payment of
compensation for the loss caused by the offence out of the fine5. Where fine is not
imposed, compensation can be awarded Under Section 357(3) Code of Criminal
Procedure to the person who suffered loss. Sentence in default can also be imposed.
The object of the provision is not merely penal but to make the Accused honour the
negotiable instruments6.
8 . In view of the above scheme, this Court held that the Accused could make an
application for compounding at the first or second hearing in which case the Court
ought to allow the same. If such application is made later, the Accused was required to
pay higher amount towards cost etc7. This Court has also laid down that even if the
payment of the cheque amount, in terms of proviso (b) to Section 138 of the Act was
not made, the Court could permit such payment being made immediately after receiving
notice/summons of the court8. The guidelines in Damodar (Supra) have been held to
be flexible as may be necessary in a given situation9. Since the concept of compounding
involves consent of the complainant, this Court held that compounding could not be
permitted merely by unilateral payment, without the consent of both the parties.10
9. While the object of the provision was to lend credibility to cheque transactions, the
effect was that it put enormous burden on the courts' dockets. The Law Commission in
its 213th Report, submitted on 24th November, 2008 noted that out of total pendency of
1.8 crores cases in the country (at that time), 38 lakh cases (about 20% of total
pendency) related to Section 138 of the Act. This Court dealt with the issue of
interpretation of 2002 amendment which was incorporated for simplified and speedy
trials. It was held that the said provision laid down a special code to do away with all
stages and processes in regular criminal trial11. This Court held that once evidence was
given on affidavit, the extent and nature of examination of such witness was to be
determined by the Court. The object of Section 145(2) was simpler and swifter trial
procedure. Only requirement is that the evidence must be admissible and relevant. The
affidavit could also prove documents12. The scheme of Sections 143 to 147 of the Act
was a departure from provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure and the Evidence Act
and complaints could be tried in a summary manner except where the Magistrate feels
that sentence of more than one year may have to be passed. Even in such cases, the
procedure to be followed may not be exactly the same as in Code of Criminal Procedure
The expression ""as far as possible"" in Section 143 leaves sufficient flexibility for the
Magistrate so as not to affect the quick flow of the trial process. The trial has to proceed
on day to day basis with endeavour to conclude the same within six months. Affidavit of
the complainant can be read as evidence. Bank's slip or memo of cheque dishonour can
give rise to the presumption of dishonour of the cheque, unless and until that fact was
disproved.
10. Again, this Court considered the matter in J.V. Baharuni and Anr. etc. v. State
of Gujarat and Anr. etc. MANU/SC/0995/2014 : (2014) 10 SCC 494 and observed
that the procedure prescribed for cases Under Section 138 of the Act was flexible and
applicability of Section 326(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure in not acting on the
evidence already recorded in a summary trial did not strictly apply to the scheme of
Section 143 of the Act13. This Court observed that the procedure being followed by the
Magistrates was not commensurate with the summary trial provisions and a successor
Magistrate ought not to mechanically order de novo trial. This Court observed that the
Court should make endeavour to expedite hearing of cases in a time bound manner. The
Magistrate should make attempts to encourage compounding of offence at an early
stage of litigation. The compensatory aspect of remedy should be given priority over the
punitive aspect14.
11. While it is true that in Subramanium Sethuraman v. State of Maharashtra
MANU/SC/0770/2004 : (2004)13 SCC 324 this Court observed that once the plea of the
Accused is recorded Under Section 252 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the
procedure contemplated under Chapter XX of the Code of Criminal Procedure has to be
followed to take the trial to its logical conclusion, the said judgment was rendered as
per statutory provisions prior to 2002 amendment. The statutory scheme post 2002
amendment as considered in Mandvi Cooperative Bank and J.V. Baharuni (supra)
has brought about a change in law and it needs to be recognised. After 2002
amendment, Section 143 of the Act confers implied power on the Magistrate to
discharge the Accused if the complainant is compensated to the satisfaction of the
Court, where the Accused tenders the cheque amount with interest and reasonable cost
of litigation as assessed by the Court. Such an interpretation was consistent with the
intention of legislature. The court has to balance the rights of the complainant and the
Accused and also to enhance access to justice. Basic object of the law is to enhance
credibility of the cheque transactions by providing speedy remedy to the complainant
without intending to punish the drawer of the cheque whose conduct is reasonable or
where compensation to the complainant meets the ends of justice. Appropriate order
can be passed by the Court in exercise of its inherent power Under Section 143 of the
Act which is different from compounding by consent of parties. Thus, Section 258 Code
of Criminal Procedure which enables proceedings to be stopped in a summons case,
even though strictly speaking is not applicable to complaint cases, since the provisions
of the Code of Criminal Procedure are applicable ""so far as may be"", the principle of the
said provision is applicable to a complaint case covered by Section 143 of the Act which
contemplates applicability of summary trial provisions, as far as possible, i.e. with such
deviation as may be necessary for speedy trial in the context.
12. The sentence prescribed Under Section 138 of the Act is upto two years or with fine
which may extend to twice the amount or with both. What needs to be noted is the fact
that power Under Section 357(3) Code of Criminal Procedure to direct payment of
compensation is in addition to the said prescribed sentence, if sentence of fine is not
imposed. The amount of compensation can be fixed having regard to the extent of loss
suffered by the action of the Accused as assessed by the Court. The direction to pay
compensation can be enforced by default sentence Under Section 64 Indian Penal Code
and by recovery procedure prescribed Under Section 431 Code of Criminal Procedure.15
13. This Court in Indian Bank Association and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.

State ILR MANU/DE/1838/2010 : (2010) 6 Del 610 laying down simpler procedure for
disposal of cases Under Section 138 of the Act. This Court directed as follows:
23. Many of the directions given by the various High Courts, in our view, are
worthy of emulation by the criminal courts all over the country dealing with
cases Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, for which the
following directions are being given: 23.1. The Metropolitan Magistrate/Judicial
Magistrate (MM/JM), on the day when the complaint Under Section 138 of the
Act is presented, shall scrutinise the complaint and, if the complaint is
accompanied by the affidavit, and the affidavit and the documents, if any, are
found to be in order, take cognizance and direct issuance of summons.
23.2. The MM/JM should adopt a pragmatic and realistic approach while issuing
summons. Summons must be properly addressed and sent by post as well as by
e-mail address got from the complainant. The court, in appropriate cases, may
take the assistance of the police or the nearby court to serve notice on the
Accused. For notice of appearance, a short date be fixed. If the summons is
received back unserved, immediate follow-up action be taken.
23.3. The court may indicate in the summons that if the Accused makes an
application for compounding of offences at the first hearing of the case and, if
such an application is made, the court may pass appropriate orders at the
earliest.
23.4. The court should direct the Accused, when he appears to furnish a bail
bond, to ensure his appearance during trial and ask him to take notice Under
Section 251 Code of Criminal Procedure. to enable him to enter his plea of
defence and fix the case for defence evidence, unless an application is made by
the Accused Under Section 145(2) for recalling a witness for cross-examination.
23.5. The court concerned must ensure that examination-in-chief, crossexamination
and re-examination of the complainant must be conducted within
three months of assigning the case. The court has option of accepting affidavits
of the witnesses instead of examining them in the court. The witnesses to the
complaint and the Accused must be available for cross-examination as and when
there is direction to this effect by the court.
24. We, therefore, direct all the criminal courts in the country dealing with
Section 138 cases to follow the abovementioned procedures for speedy and
expeditious disposal of cases falling Under Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act. The writ petition is, accordingly, disposed of, as above.
14. We may, however, note that this Court held that general directions ought not to be
issued which may deprive the Magistrate to exercise power Under Section 205 Code of
Criminal Procedure16 We need to clarify that the judgment of this Court is not a bar to
issue directions which do not affect the exercise of power Under Section 205, to require
personal attendance wherever necessary. Needless to say that the judgment cannot be
read as affecting the power of the High Court Under Article 225 of the Constitution read
with Articles 227 and 235 to issue directions to subordinate courts without affecting the
prevailing statutory scheme.
1 5 . I n Bhaskar Industries Ltd. v. Bhiwani Denim & Apparels Ltd.
MANU/SC/0489/2001 : (2001) 7 SCC 401, this Court considered the issue of hardship
caused in personal attendance by an Accused particularly where Accused is located far
away from the jurisdiction of the Court where the complaint is filed. This Court held that
even in absence of Accused, evidence can be recorded in presence of counsel Under
Section 273 Code of Criminal Procedure and Section 317 Code of Criminal Procedure
permitted trial to be held in absence of Accused. Section 205 Code of Criminal
Procedure specifically enabled the Magistrate to dispense with the personal appearance.
Having regard to the nature of offence Under Section 138, this Court held that the
Magistrates ought to consider exercise of the jurisdiction Under Section 205 Code of
Criminal Procedure to relieve Accused of the hardship without prejudice to the
prosecution proceedings. It was observed:
15. These are days when prosecutions for the offence Under Section 138 are
galloping up in criminal courts. Due to the increase of inter-State transactions
through the facilities of the banks it is not uncommon that when prosecutions
are instituted in one State the Accused might belong to a different State,
sometimes a far distant State. Not very rarely such Accused would be ladies
also. For prosecution Under Section 138 of the NI Act the trial should be that of
summons case. When a magistrate feels that insistence of personal attendance
of the Accused in a summons case, in a particular situation, would inflict
enormous hardship and cost to a particular Accused, it is open to the magistrate
to consider how he can relieve such an Accused of the great hardships, without
causing prejudice to the prosecution proceedings.
16. It is, thus, clear that the trials under Chapter XVII of the Act are expected normally
to be summary trial. Once the complaint is filed which is accompanied by the
dishonored cheque and the bank's slip and the affidavit, the Court ought to issue
summons. The service of summons can be by post/e-mail/courier and ought to be
properly monitored. The summons ought to indicate that the Accused could make
specified payment by deposit in a particular account before the specified date and
inform the court and the complainant by e-mail. In such a situation, he may not be
required to appear if the court is satisfied that the payment has not been duly made and
if the complainant has no valid objection. If the Accused is required to appear, his
statement ought to be recorded forthwith and the case fixed for defence evidence,
unless complainant's witnesses are recalled for examination.
17. Having regard to magnitude of challenge posed by cases filed Under Section 138 of
the Act, which constitute about 20% of the total number of cases filed in the Courts (as
per 213th Report of the Law Commission) and earlier directions of this Court in this
regard, it appears to be necessary that the situation is reviewed by the High Courts and
updated directions are issued. Interactions, action plans and monitoring are continuing
steps mandated by Articles 39A and 21 of the Constitution to achieve the goal of access
to justice17. Use of modern technology needs to be considered not only for paperless
courts but also to reduce overcrowding of courts. There appears to be need to consider
categories of cases which can be partly or entirely concluded ""online"" without physical
presence of the parties by simplifying procedures where seriously disputed questions
are not required to be adjudicated. Traffic challans may perhaps be one such category.
Atleast some number of Section 138 cases can be decided online. If complaint with
affidavits and documents can be filed online, process issued online and Accused pays
the specified amount online, it may obviate the need for personal appearance of the
complainant or the Accused. Only if the Accused contests, need for appearance of
parties may arise which may be through counsel and wherever viable, video
conferencing can be used. Personal appearances can be dispensed with on suitable self
operating conditions. This is a matter to be considered by the High Courts and wherever
viable, appropriate directions can be issued.
18. From the above discussion following aspects emerge:
i) Offence Under Section 138 of the Act is primarily a civil wrong. Burden of
proof is on Accused in view presumption Under Section 139 but the standard of
such proof is ""preponderance of probabilities"". The same has to be normally
tried summarily as per provisions of summary trial under the Code of Criminal
Procedure but with such variation as may be appropriate to proceedings under
Chapter XVII of the Act. Thus read, principle of Section 258 Code of Criminal
Procedure will apply and the Court can close the proceedings and discharge the
Accused on satisfaction that the cheque amount with assessed costs and
interest is paid and if there is no reason to proceed with the punitive aspect.
ii) The object of the provision being primarily compensatory, punitive element
being mainly with the object of enforcing the compensatory element,
compounding at the initial stage has to be encouraged but is not debarred at
later stage subject to appropriate compensation as may be found acceptable to
the parties or the Court.
iii) Though compounding requires consent of both parties, even in absence of
such consent, the Court, in the interests of justice, on being satisfied that the
complainant has been duly compensated, can in its discretion close the
proceedings and discharge the Accused.
iv) Procedure for trial of cases under Chapter XVII of the Act has normally to be
summary. The discretion of the Magistrate under second proviso to Section 143,
to hold that it was undesirable to try the case summarily as sentence of more
than one year may have to be passed, is to be exercised after considering the
further fact that apart from the sentence of imprisonment, the Court has
jurisdiction Under Section 357(3) Code of Criminal Procedure to award suitable
compensation with default sentence Under Section 64 Indian Penal Code and
with further powers of recovery Under Section 431 Code of Criminal Procedure
With this approach, prison sentence of more than one year may not be required
in all cases.
v) Since evidence of the complaint can be given on affidavit, subject to the
Court summoning the person giving affidavit and examining him and the bank's
slip being prima facie evidence of the dishonor of cheque, it is unnecessary for
the Magistrate to record any further preliminary evidence. Such affidavit
evidence can be read as evidence at all stages of trial or other proceedings. The
manner of examination of the person giving affidavit can be as per Section 264
Code of Criminal Procedure The scheme is to follow summary procedure except
where exercise of power under second proviso to Section 143 becomes
necessary, where sentence of one year may have to be awarded and
compensation Under Section 357(3) is considered inadequate, having regard to
the amount of the cheque, the financial capacity and the conduct of the Accused
or any other circumstances.
19. In view of the above, we hold that where the cheque amount with interest and cost
as assessed by the Court is paid by a specified date, the Court is entitled to close the
proceedings in exercise of its powers Under Section 143 of the Act read with Section
258 Code of Criminal Procedure As already observed, normal Rule for trial of cases
under Chapter XVII of the Act is to follow the summary procedure and summons trial
procedure can be followed where sentence exceeding one year may be necessary taking
into account the fact that compensation Under Section 357(3) Code of Criminal
Procedure with sentence of less than one year will not be adequate, having regard to
the amount of cheque, conduct of the Accused and other circumstances.
2 0 . In every complaint Under Section 138 of the Act, it may be desirable that the
complainant gives his bank account number and if possible e-mail ID of the Accused. If
e-mail ID is available with the Bank where the Accused has an account, such Bank, on
being required, should furnish such e-mail ID to the payee of the cheque. In every
summons, issued to the Accused, it may be indicated that if the Accused deposits the
specified amount, which should be assessed by the Court having regard to the cheque
amount and interest/cost, by a specified date, the Accused need not appear unless
required and proceedings may be closed subject to any valid objection of the
complainant. If the Accused complies with such summons and informs the Court and the
complainant by e-mail, the Court can ascertain the objection, if any, of the complainant
and close the proceedings unless it becomes necessary to proceed with the case. In
such a situation, the Accused's presence can be required, unless the presence is
otherwise exempted subject to such conditions as may be considered appropriate. The
Accused, who wants to contest the case, must be required to disclose specific defence
for such contest. It is open to the Court to ask specific questions to the Accused at that
stage. In case the trial is to proceed, it will be open to the Court to explore the
possibility of settlement. It will also be open to the Court to consider the provisions of
plea bargaining. Subject to this, the trial can be on day to day basis and endeavour
must be to conclude it within six months. The guilty must be punished at the earliest as
per law and the one who obeys the law need not be held up in proceedings for long
unnecessarily.

CRIMINAL MATTERS - MATTERS CHALLENGING PROSECUTION UNDER NEGOTIABLE
INSTRUMENTS ACT
Facts:
The Respondent filed complaint alleging that the Appellants were to pay a
monthly amount to her under an agreement. Cheque was given in discharge
of legal liability but the same was returned unpaid for want of sufficient
funds. In spite of service of legal notice, the amount having not been paid,
the Appellants committed the offence under Section 138 of the Act. The
Magistrate vide order, after considering the complaint and the preliminary
evidence, summoned the Appellants. The Magistrate in the order observed
that the case could not be tried summarily as sentence of more than one year
may have to be passed and be tried as summons case. Notice of accusation
was served, 2nd Appellant, made a statement that he was ready to make the
payment of the cheque amount. However, the complainant declined to accept
the demand draft. The case was adjourned for evidence. The Appellants filed
an application under Section 147 of the Act. The application was dismissed.
The High Court did not find any ground to interfere with the order of the
Magistrate. Hence these appeals.
Held, while disposing off the appeal:
(i) Where the cheque amount with interest and cost as assessed by the Court
was paid by a specified date, the Court was entitled to close the proceedings
in exercise of its powers under Section 143 of the Act read with Section 258
Code of Criminal Procedure, normal Rule for trial of cases under Chapter XVII
of the Act is to follow the summary procedure and summons trial procedure
could be followed where sentence exceeding one year may be necessary
taking into account the fact that compensation under Section 357(3) Code of
Criminal Procedure with sentence of less than one year would not be
adequate, having regard to the amount of cheque, conduct of the Accused and
other circumstances. [19]
(ii) In every complaint under Section 138 of the Act, it may be desirable that
the complainant gives his bank account number and if possible e-mail ID of
the Accused. If e-mail ID was available with the Bank where the Accused has
an account, such Bank, on being required, should furnish such e-mail ID to
the payee of the cheque. In every summons, issued to the Accused, it may be
indicated that if the Accused deposits the specified amount, which should be
assessed by the Court having regard to the cheque amount and interest/cost,
by a specified date, the Accused need not appear unless required and
proceedings may be closed subject to any valid objection of the complainant.
If the Accused complies with such summons and informs the Court and the
complainant by e-mail, the Court can ascertain the objection, if any, of the
complainant and close the proceedings unless it becomes necessary to
proceed with the case. In such a situation, the Accused's presence could be
required, unless the presence was otherwise exempted subject to such
conditions as may be considered appropriate. The Accused, who wants to
contest the case, must be required to disclose specific defence for such
contest. It was open to the Court to ask specific questions to the Accused at
that stage. In case the trial was to proceed, it would be open to the Court to
explore the possibility of settlement. It would also be open to the Court to
consider the provisions of plea bargaining. Subject to this, the trial can be on
day to day basis and endeavour must be to conclude it within six months. The
guilty must be punished at the earliest as per law and the one who obeys the
law need not be held up in proceedings for long unnecessarily. [20]

"U.U. Lalit, J.
1. State Bank of India and 13 other banks1 have filed the instant special leave petitions
challenging the order dated 04.03.2016 passed by the High Court of Karnataka at
Bengaluru in Writ Petition Nos. 12191-12194 of 2016 refusing to pass any ad interim
order against Respondent Nos. 3, 10 and 11. According to the Petitioners-banks they
had individually advanced to Respondent No. 1 loans of thousands of crores of rupees;
that by Master Debts Recast Agreement dated 21.10.2010 and other related documents
the existing loans were restructured and treated as a single facility; and that
Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 executed a corporate guarantee dated 21.12.2010 and a
personal guarantee dated 21.12.2010 respectively, guaranteeing repayment of the entire
amount due. Further, since the above accounts were classified as non-performing
assets, the Petitioners-banks filed OA No. 766 of 2013 against Respondent Nos. 1 to 9
before Debt Recovery Tribunal, Bengaluru (for short ""DRT Bengaluru), inter alia seeking
recovery of Rs. 6203,35,03,879.32 (Rupees Six Thousand Two Hundred and Three
Crores Thirty Five Lakhs Three thousand Eight Hundred and Seventy Nine and Paise
Thirty Two only) from Respondent Nos. 1 to 4. It is the case of the Petitioners-banks
that despite applications having been filed requiring Respondent Nos. 1 to 4 to disclose
details of their assets on oath, said Respondents never disclosed the assets and instead,
said Respondents secretly tried to dispose of their assets with an intention to defeat the
recovery proceedings pending before DRT Bengaluru.
2 . According to the Petitioners-banks, on 25.02.2016 Respondent Nos. 10 and 11
disclosed to London Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange respectively that
Respondent No. 3 had resigned as Chairman of Respondent No. 11; that Respondent
No. 10 would pay to Respondent No. 3 a sum of US$ 75 million; that out of said
amount a sum of US$ 40 million would be paid immediately; and that Respondent No. 3
had made a statement to the press confirming said transaction and had stated that he
intended to settle in London. In these circumstances, the Petitioners-banks moved four
interlocutory applications before DRT Bengaluru on 02.03.2016 seeking interim prayers:
(i) to freeze the passport of Respondent No. 3
(ii) to issue an arrest warrant against Respondent No. 3,
(iii) to issue a garnishee order against Respondent Nos. 10 and 11 from
disbursing US$ 75 million, and
(iv) to issue a direction to Respondent No. 3 to disclose his assets on oath.
3. It is the case of the Petitioners-banks that DRT Bengaluru heard arguments only with
respect to the Garnishee Application on 02.03.2016 and posted the matters for orders
on 04.03.2016 but failed to consider the other applications. Aggrieved by such nonconsideration
of the interlocutory applications by DRT Bengaluru, despite the urgency
and the enormous amounts involved in the matter, the Petitioners-banks moved the
High Court of Karnataka by filing Writ Petition Nos. 12191-12194 of 2016 seeking
appropriate directions to DRT Bengaluru to hear and dispose of the applications moved
by the Petitioners-banks on 02.03.2016 expeditiously. Since the High Court refused to
pass any ad interim direction, the aforesaid special leave petitions were filed in this
Court.
4 . By Order dated 09.03.2016 this Court issued notice returnable on 30.03.2016 and
also permitted the Petitioners-banks to serve notice on Respondent No. 3 through the
Indian High Commission, London or any other Embassy. The Order dated 30.03.2016
discloses that Mr. C.S. Vaidyanathan, learned Senior Advocate appeared on behalf of
Respondent Nos. 1 and 3 and the Order recorded his submission that a proposal was
already given to the Chairperson of State Bank of India (Consortium leader of banks)
for settlement of dues of Respondent Nos. 1 to 4.
5. The matter came up on 07.04.2016 when the Counsel appearing for the Petitionersbanks
submitted that the offer made by Respondent Nos. 1 to 4 was not acceptable
though the Consortium was not against any settlement provided the Respondents
showed their bona fides for a meaningful negotiation. This Court observed in its Order
dated 7.04.2016:
As a pre-condition to such steps on bona fides, it is submitted that the third
Respondent should first of all disclose, on oath, the details of all the propertiesmovable,
immovable, tangible, intangible, shareholdings and any right, title or
interest including beneficial interest and those held in fiduciary capacity, in
private trusts, public trusts, companies, partnerships, limited liability
partnerships, and/or any other entity/ies both in India and abroad etc. in any
form and there should be a substantial deposit made before this Court....
... Mr. C.S. Vaidyanathan and Mr. Parag P. Tripathi, learned Senior Counsel
appearing for Respondent Nos. 1 to 4 have submitted that they may be given
short time to file their response to the main petition.
Accordingly, they are granted time upto 21.04.2016 to file their response. In
the response filed by the third Respondent, he shall disclose the details of all
his properties-movable, immovable, tangible, intangible, shareholdings and any
right, title or interest including beneficial interest and those held in fiduciary
capacity, in private trusts, public trusts, companies, partnerships, limited
liability partnerships, and/or any other entity/ies both in India and abroad etc.
in any form whatsoever and also the rights, indicated above, in the name also
of his wife and children, as on 31.03.2016.
It shall also be indicated in the response as to what is the amount he is
prepared to deposit before this Court so as to show his bonafide for a
meaningful negotiation. Mr. C.S. Vaidyanathan and Mr. Parag P. Tripathi,
learned Senior Counsel, have submitted that on the next date of hearing,
specific instruction shall be obtained from the third Respondent as to his
probable date of appearance in person before this Court.
6 . The matter thereafter came up on 26.04.2016, by which time counter affidavit was
filed by Respondent No. 3 disclosing his personal assets to the tune of Rs.
20,174,146,601, majority of which had been under attachment by the Income Tax
Department. The details of the assets of Respondent No. 3 situated outside the country
and those of his wife and children were furnished in a sealed cover. This Court, in its
Order dated 26.04.2016 observed:
...It is also submitted that the personal guarantee executed by the 3rd
Respondent with the banks do not cover his assets abroad. We have no problem
in recording the above submissions and we do so. However, we find that in the
Order dated 7.04.2016, this Court had directed the Respondent No. 3 to
disclose the assets in an affidavit. The only purpose for disclosing the assets
was to have a fair idea for the Petitioners to go for a meaningful settlement on
the proposals made by Respondent No. 3. There is no petition before us for
clarification or modification of Order dated 07.04.2016. In the above
circumstances, we do not find any tenable objection in disclosing these assets
to the Petitioners.
The learned senior Counsel further submits that the wife and children are
American citizens and they are not the parties before this Court. Whatever
protection is available to them under law, they are free to avail. This disclosure
is only for the purpose of enabling the Petitioners to have a fair idea for a
meaningful settlement.
We are distressed to note that Respondent No. 3 has not responded to our
Order dated 7th April, 2016 in the letter and spirit of the said Order. He was to
show us his bonafides by showing the color of money in the form of a
substantial deposit towards dues in the region of 18,000 crores to arrive at a
meaningful settlement. It appears there is no bonafides in his offer for
settlement. Apparently, statements made by counsel on his behalf were made
only as a ploy to gain time.
The Registry is directed to disclose the statement of assets furnished in the
sealed cover, to the Petitioners.
7 . On 28.06.2016 Respondent No. 10 filed a memo in O.A. No. 766 of 2013 pending
before DRT, Bengaluru along with two documents stating that an amount of US$ 40
million was paid to Respondent No. 3 on 25.02.2016. Said memo was to the following
effect:
MEMO
The opponent 2 in the above application begs to submit the below mentioned
documents:
1 . Extract confirming payment of US$ (US Dollars) 40 Million to
Defendant No. 3 on 25.02.2016.
2. Resignation of Defendant No. 3 from the Board of United Spirits Ltd.
WHEREFORE the Opponent No. 2 prays that this Memo and enclosures
be taken on record in the interests of justice.
8 . On 14.7.2016 I.A. Nos. 9 to 12 of 2016 were filed by the Petitioners-banks stating
that the disclosure statement made by Respondent No. 3 and furnished to the
Petitioners-banks in terms of the aforesaid Order dated 26.04.2016 was vague and
lacked in material particulars; that the location of the assets mentioned in the statement
was so unclear that it would be impossible for any person to identify the location of the
property; and that Respondent No. 3 had undisputedly received a sum of US$ 40 million
as disclosed in the memo dated 28.06.2016 but there was no whisper about said
amount in the disclosure statement. It was submitted:
1 8 . It is therefore clear that Respondent No. 3 has willfully disobeyed the
directions issued by this Hon'ble Court on 7.04.2016. Respondent No. 3 is
therefore guilty of contempt of the Order dated 29.04.2016 passed by this
Hon'ble Court. The Petitioners' reserve liberty to initiate appropriate
proceedings against the Respondent No. 3 in this regards.
...
2 2 . In view of the above, it is just and necessary that this Application is
allowed and Respondent No. 3 is directed to disclose and furnish all particulars
and all descriptions of all his properties-movable, immovable, tangible,
intangible, shareholdings and any right, title or interest including beneficial
interest and those held in fiduciary capacity, in private trusts, public trusts,
companies, partnerships, limited liability partnerships, and/or any other
entity/ies both in India and abroad etc. in any form whatsoever as on
31.03.2016. If this application is not allowed as prayed for, the Petitioner and
the public at large will be put to irreparable loss and injury.
In the circumstances it was prayed that Respondent No. 3 be directed to make a
complete and detailed disclosure of the assets as directed by this Court in its Order
dated 7.04.2016.
9 . On 14.07.2016 itself the Petitioners-banks filed Contempt Petition Nos. 421-424 of
2016 submitting that appropriate contempt proceedings be initiated for deliberate and
willful violation of the Order dated 7.04.2016 passed by this Court. Paragraphs 20 to 24
of the petition were as under:
20. A reading of the Disclosure Statement made by Contemnor clearly reveals
that the Contemnor has not at all obeyed the directions of this Hon'ble Court
dated 07.04.2016. One of the primary directions given by this Hon'ble Court to
the Contemnor was that he should disclose the proper details of all his
properties-movable, immovable, tangible, intangible, shareholdings and any
right, title or interest including beneficial interests and those held in fiduciary
capacity, in private trusts, public trusts, companies, partnerships, limited
liability partnerships, and/or any other entity/ies both in India and abroad etc.
in any form whatsoever, as on 31.03.2016. However, Contemnor has not at all
disclosed the details of the assets in various forms/entities such as beneficial
interest, etc. and thereby intentionally concealing the information. In fact, there
is no whisper regarding the said details in the Disclosure Statement.
21. The disclosure is prima facie vague and lacks any material particulars. The
location of the assets mentioned in the Disclosure Statement is so unclear that
it is not practically possible for any person other than the Alleged Contemnor to
identify the location of the properties.
22. Further, it is stated that the Alleged Contemnor had received a sum of US$
40 million from Respondent No. 10 pursuant to an Agreement dated 25.02.2016
entered into between Respondent No. 3 and Respondent No. 10.
23. It is pertinent to mention here that after disposal of the captioned Special
Leave Petition, on 28.06.2016 the Respondent No. 10 filed a Memo along with
two documents in the DRT, stating that the above mentioned amount of US$ 40
million was paid to alleged Contemnor on 25.02.2016. A copy of the said Memo
dated 28.06.2016 is annexed herewith ...
24. A reading of the above documents clearly establishes that as on 26.04.2016
when the alleged Contemnor filed the Disclosure Statement in this Hon'ble
Court, the alleged Contemnor had already received the above mentioned
amount of US$ 40 million before 31.03.2016. In fact the memo clearly shows
that the said amount of US$ 40 million was transferred by Citi Bank, being
Respondent No. 10's bank, via J.P. Morgan Chase N.A. Bank (intermediary
Bank) to the account of the Alleged Contemnor being maintained with Edmond
De Rothschild (Suisse) SA Geneva. However, there is no whisper of the above
mentioned amount or the transaction in the Disclosure Statement. The alleged
Contemnor had deliberately, willfully and contumaciously concealed the
aforementioned payment/transaction which is against the letter and spirit of the
Order dated 07.04.2016.
10. On 25.07.2016 this Court issued notice in aforesaid contempt petition as well as in
I.A. Nos. 9 to 12 of 2016.
11. On 24.08.2016 counter affidavit was filed on behalf of Respondent Nos. 1 to 4 in
I.A. Nos. 9 to 12 of 2016. It was submitted:
... it is incorrect that in the disclosures the Respondent No. 3 has provided
information pertaining to only a few of his overseas assets as on 31.03.2016 as
alleged. The Respondent No. 3 reiterates that the disclosures made to this
Hon'ble Court are accurate. It is respectfully submitted that in view of what is
recorded in the Order dated 26th April, 2016 as to the purpose of the
disclosures, it is now not open to the Petitioners-banks to contend that in the
event that the DRT allows the Original Application, the Petitioners-banks may
not be able to proceed against the properties mentioned in the disclosures as
alleged or for reasons alleged. In this regard, it is pertinent to mention that the
Respondent No. 3 had expressly submitted before this Hon'ble Court on 26th
April, 2016 that ""the personal guarantee executed by the 3rd Respondent with
the banks do not cover his assets abroad"". It is denied that all particulars and
all descriptions of the assets as contemplated by the Order dated 7th April,
2016 have not been provided, deliberately or otherwise. It is denied that there
is any reason or basis for directing the Respondent No. 3 to once again disclose
and furnish particulars and description of his properties as alleged or in the
manner alleged. It is denied that if the I.A. of the Petitioners-banks is not
allowed, the Petitioners or the public at large will be put to irreparable loss or
injury.
12. Applications being I.A. Nos. 1 to 4 of 2016 were also filed on behalf of Respondent
No. 3/Alleged Contemnor for recall of Order dated 25.07.2016 passed by this Court
issuing notice in contempt petition. It was submitted by Respondent No. 3:
...It is further submitted that the disclosures made by Respondent No. 3/Alleged
Contemnor to this Hon'ble Court were (a) pursuant to the Order dated 7th April,
2016 were made ""as on 31.03.2016"" and were accurate as on 31.03.2016"", and
(b) far from being made under the provisions of Order 21 Rule 41(2) of the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, were ""only for the purpose of enabling the
Petitioners to have a fair idea for a meaningful settlement"" as observed in the
order dated 26th April, 2016. It is respectfully submitted that the Petitioners are
incorrectly alleging that the disclosures are inaccurate, and are now seeking to
substantially alter the basis and purpose of the disclosures, as is evident from a
mere perusal of the submissions in paragraphs 21 and 25 of the present
Contempt Petition.
...It is denied that Respondent No. 3 has not obeyed the directions of this
Hon'ble Court dated 7th April, 2016 or has not disclosed the details of the
assets as alleged or in the manner alleged. It is denied that the disclosure is
vague or lacks material particulars. It is denied that the location of the assets in
the disclosure is unclear as alleged or in the manner alleged. The statement of
assets is as on a particular date, obviously it cannot detail the day to day
transactions of receipts or expenditures; nor did the order require the present
Respondent to do so. It is denied that the Respondent No. 3/Alleged Contemnor
has deliberately or willfully or contumaciously concealed the aforesaid payment
against the letter and spirit of the Order dated 7th April, 2016.
While seeking recall of the Order dated 25.07.2016 it was also prayed that the personal
appearance of Respondent No. 3/Alleged Contemnor in the present contempt petition be
dispensed with.
13. Around this time I.A. Nos. 13 to 16 were filed on behalf of B.N.P. Paribas seeking
impleadment in aforesaid Special Leave Petition Nos. 6828-6831 of 2016.
1 4 . On 29.08.2016, this Court issued notice in respect of I.A. Nos. 1 to 4 of 2016
seeking recall of the Order dated 25.07.2016. In their reply filed on 07.09.2016 to
aforesaid I.A. Nos. 1 to 4 of 2016, it was submitted by the Petitioners-banks that the
alleged contemnor had not filed any reply to the contempt petition nor had he appeared
in person in response to the contempt petition as required by Rule 6(1) of Rules to
Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of Supreme Court 1975 and that present application
for recall was a mere ruse to circumvent the law. It was submitted:
6 . The Alleged Contemnor has received the sum of US$ 40 million from
Respondent No. 10 pursuant to an Agreement dated 25-02-2016 entered into
between Respondent No. 3 and Respondent No. 10. However, the Alleged
Contemnor has suppressed the receipt of US$ 40 million from Respondent No.
10 even in the Application under reply. The non disclosure of whereabouts of
US$ 40 million received from Respondent No. 10 further discredits the Alleged
Contemnor.
7 . The Alleged Contemnor has not denied the existence of his bank account
held in Edmond De Rothschild Bank, Geneva. However, details of this bank
account did not find mention in the list of his foreign assets filed before this
Hon'ble Court on 26.04.2016. It is respectfully submitted that this is an act of
willful concealment and the Alleged Contemnor is in violation of Order dated
07-04-2016 passed by this Hon'ble Court.
15. When IA Nos. 9-12 of 2016 along with Contempt Petition Nos. 421-424 of 2016
came up before this Court on 25.10.2016, it was prima facie found that Respondent No.
3 had not made a proper disclosure. In the premises, this Court observed and directed:
Having heard learned Attorney General appearing for the applicants and Shri
C.S. Vaidyanathan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Respondent No. 3, we
are prima facie of the view that Respondent No. 3 has not made a proper
disclosure in terms of our Order dated 07.04.2016. Therefore, Respondent No.
3 is directed to make a complete disclosure of all his properties and in
particular, about the receipt of US$ 40 Million. It shall be disclosed as to when
this amount was received; where was it deposited and how the same has been
dealt with up to date. Respondent No. 3 shall also furnish the particulars of the
assets abroad with full details thereof, as has been given with regard to the
assets in India.
16. Respondent No. 3 thereafter filed ""further counter affidavit"" in aforementioned I.A.
Nos. 9-12 of 2016 on 23.11.2016. The affidavit enclosed letter dated 18.11.2016 issued
by Edmond De Rothschild (Suisse) S.A. Paragraph 3 of the affidavit was to the following
effect:
On a mere perusal of the letter dated 18th November, 2016 issued by Edmond
De Rothschild (Suisse) S.A. (Annex. ""R-2"" hereto), it is evident that the US$
39,999,994 million paid by Diageo Plc was received on 25th February, 2016. On
instructions of Respondent No. 3, an aggregate sum of US$ 39,999,993.99 was
paid to the following parties on 26th and 29th February, 2016 respectively:
Each of the three children of Respondent No. 3, who are the sole beneficiaries
of the aforesaid Trusts, are majors and are citizens of the United States of
America. Respondent No. 3 is neither the Settlor nor the Trustee nor the
beneficiary of any of the aforesaid named Trusts, and has no control over the
Trusts or the manner in which the respective corpuses of each of the aforesaid
Trusts is utilized. However, the respective corpuses as they stood on 31st
March, 2016 have been included in the statements of assets of the three
children handed over to this Hon'ble Court in sealed envelope on 26th April,
2016.
17. The response was thereafter filed by the Petitioners-banks to the aforementioned
""further counter affidavit"" filed by Respondent No. 3. Attention was invited to the
restraint Orders passed by the High Court of Karnataka on 03.09.2013 and 13.11.2013.
It was submitted that the transfer of US$ 40 million by Respondent No. 3 to his children
was not only in contempt of the Orders passed by the High Court but was also an
attempt to subvert the Course of Justice by diverting the funds to shield them from
ongoing recovery proceedings. Paragraphs 13 to 16 of the reply were as under:
1 3 . Notwithstanding the above, it is respectfully submitted that pursuant to
filing of O.A. No. 766/2013 before the Hon'ble DRT, Bengaluru, on 26.07.2013,
Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 gave an oral undertaking before the Hon'ble DRT, that
they would not alienate or dispose of their properties. Thereafter, since no
interim order was passed by the Hon'ble DRT, Petitioners filed a writ petition
bearing W.P. No. 38870/2013 & W.P. No. 39048-39052/2013 before the
Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka, seeking a writ in the nature of Mandamus
directing the Hon'ble DRT to hear and dispose of the interlocutory applications
filed by the Petitioners in the OA i.e. IA No. 2593/2013 to 2598/2013 & IA No.
3034/2013 expeditiously. In the aforesaid writ petition, the Hon'ble High Court
of Karnataka was pleased to pass a restraint Order on 03.09.2013 against
Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 herein in the following terms:
In that view, there shall be interim order of injunction against the
Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 from transferring, alienating, disposing or
creating third party rights in respect of movable as well as immovable
properties belonging to them until further order in these petitions.""
(emphasis supplied)
14. The said order was further confirmed by the order dated 13.11.2013 passed
in the above mentioned writ petitions, whereby the said writ petitions were
disposed of. Copy of the orders dated 03.09.2013 and 13.11.2013 passed by
the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in W.P. No. 38870/2013 & W.P. No. 39048-
39052/2013 are annexed ...
15. Therefore, it is clear that the Respondent No. 3 has clearly and flagrantly
violated the orders of the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka and is guilty of
contempt of Court. It is stated that by transferring the US$ 40 million to his
children, the Respondent No. 3 has not only acted in contempt of the Hon'ble
High Court, but has also tried to subvert the course of justice by diverting the
funds offshore to shield it from the recovery proceedings on going before the
Hon'ble DRT. Therefore, it is essential that the said US$ 40 million be brought
back by the Respondent No. 3 and be deposited with this Hon'ble Court, or the
Hon'ble DRT, pending the disposal of the recovery proceedings. It is further
submitted that it is settled law that this Hon'ble Court has the power to punish
for contempt of its subordinate Courts. Therefore, it is prayed that this Hon'ble
Court hold the Respondent No. 3 guilty of contempt of the Hon'ble High Court
of Karnataka.
16. It is further pointed out that even the statement that the Respondent No. 3
has transferred the said US$ 40 million to his children does not hold water. On
perusal of the further counter affidavit of the Respondent No. 3, the explanation
provided by the Respondent No. 3 regarding the disbursal of US$ 40 million
prima facie does not correlate with the statements given on behalf of his
children. The Respondent No. 3 has failed to explain why the US$ 40 million
was disbursed to his children despite an oral undertaking to the contrary given
before the Hon'ble DRT on 26.07.2014, and despite being injuncted by way of
orders dated 03.09.2013 and 13.11.2013 passed by the Hon'ble High Court of
Karnataka in W.P. No. 38870/2013 & W.P. No. 39048-39052/2013. The said
orders injuncting the Respondent No. 3 from alienating his assets has attained
finality as it was never challenged by the Respondent No. 3 till date.
1 8 . I.A. Nos. 9-12 of 2016 along with Contempt Petition Nos. 421-424 of 2016
thereafter came up before this Court on 11.01.2017. Having gone through the response
filed by the Petitioners-banks to ""further counter affidavit"" filed by Respondent No. 3
which inter alia referred to the orders dated 03.09.2013 and 13.11.2013 passed by the
High Court of Karnataka, this Court passed the following Order:
In the affidavit filed on 10.12.2016, the Petitioners have brought to the notice
of this Court that the transfer of US$ 40 Million in favour of the children of
Respondent No. 3 is in flagrant violation of the orders passed by the High Court
of Karnataka. Therefore, it is prayed that appropriate orders may be issued to
secure the deposit of the said amount of US$ 40 Million before this Court or the
DRT forthwith, pending disposal of the further recovery proceedings.
The learned senior Counsel appearing for Respondent No. 3 seeks three weeks'
time to file reply to the submission.
19. Despite the aforesaid Order dated 11.01.2017 which took note of the violation of
the orders passed by the High Court of Karnataka and though time was sought to file
reply, nothing was filed in reply or rebuttal by Respondent No. 3.
20. When the aforesaid IA Nos. 9-12 of 2016 along with Contempt Petition Nos. 421-
424 of 2016 with application IA Nos. 1-4 of 2016 seeking recall of the Order dated
25.07.2016, came up for hearing, Mr. Mukul Rohtagi, learned Attorney General for India
and Mr. Shyam Divan, learned senior advocate appeared on behalf of the Petitioners-
banks while Mr. C.S. Vaidyanathan, learned senior advocate appeared for Respondent
No. 3. It was submitted by the learned Attorney General that Respondent No. 3 had
made no honest disclosure and in fact there was a deliberate attempt to flout the Order
of this Court. In his submission, Respondent No. 3 must first of all be directed to
deposit US$ 40 million which he had transferred in violation of the Orders of the Courts,
before he could be heard in the matter. Mr. Divan, learned senior Counsel submitted
that the orders dated 3.9.2013 and 13.11.2013 were clear and unambiguous. He further
submitted that the breach on part of Respondent No. 3 was willful and deliberate and
that it was a clear attempt in over-reaching the Court and putting the amounts beyond
the reach of the Court.
Mr. Vaidyanathan, learned senior advocate on the other hand submitted that Respondent
No. 3 was not asked or called upon to disclose all transactions but to disclose the status
as it obtained on 31.03.2016 and as such the disclosure by Respondent No. 3 was
consistent with the tenor of the order passed by this Court. In his submission the
amount of US$ 40 million was pursuant to Non-Compete agreement with Diageo Plc and
was received after the orders passed by the High Court of Karnataka on 03.09.2013 and
13.11.2013. He further submitted that the width of those orders did not cover or include
any moneys which the Respondents would receive in future and as such there was no
violation of those orders at all. He relied upon the decision of this Court in Indian
Airports Employees' Union v. Ranjan Chatterjee and Anr. MANU/SC/0048/1999 :
(1999) 2 SCC 537 and submitted that since the matter involved interpretation of the
orders at 3.09.2013 and 13.11.2013 it cannot be said that there was any willful
disobedience of the orders. He further submitted that the violation if any, was that of
the orders passed by the High Court of Karnataka and as such this Court ought not to
take cognizance of such alleged violation inasmuch as it would deny Respondent No. 3
the opportunity to place the matter before the High Court.
21. The orders passed by this Court were clear and unambiguous and Respondent No. 3
was called upon to make complete disclosure of his assets. Whether the assets to be so
disclosed were covered by the personal guarantee given by Respondent No. 3 or not
was immaterial. He was called upon to make a complete disclosure and was bound to
comply with the directions. The assertion made by the Petitioners-banks that the details
of the bank account held in Edmond De Rothschild Bank were never disclosed by
Respondent No. 3 is correct. In fact, no details of any bank account with overseas banks
were given by Respondent No. 3. The violation by Respondent No. 3 could not be
termed as a mere infraction. The violation by Respondent No. 3 regarding nondisclosure
becomes more pronounced because it is this very account held in Edmond De
Rothschild Bank that was utilized to transmit funds to the tune of US$ 40 Million.
22. We now turn to the alleged violation of orders dated 03.09.2013 and 13.11.2013
passed by the High Court of Karnataka. It is not disputed that such orders were passed
restraining the concerned Respondents including Respondent No. 3 and that the orders
were passed in proceedings arising from O.A. No. 766 of 2013 before DRT Bengaluru.
The present proceedings before this Court have also arisen from the very same O.A. No.
766 of 2013. The orders of restraints passed by the High Court were therefore in the
very same proceedings with which we are presently concerned. Said orders bound the
concerned Respondents including Respondent No. 3 and restrained them from
transferring, alienating, disposing or creating third party rights in respect of movable as
well as immovable properties belonging to them till further orders in the proceedings. A
question has been raised by Mr. Vaidyanathan learned senior advocate whether the
orders would be restricted only so far as the properties which were in the hands of the
concerned Respondents as on the date when those orders of restraint were passed. In
other words, whether any properties which in future or subsequent to the Orders had
come in the hands or control of the concerned Respondent would be covered by such
orders or not. On plain reading of the Orders, in our view, whether the properties were
in the hands of the concerned Respondents on the date when the orders of restraint
were passed by the High Court or had come in their hands or under their control at a
later point in time, regardless of such qualification all properties whether movable or
immovable were governed by the orders of restraint. There is no ambiguity of any sort
and the Orders of restraint are quite clear. Consequently, funds amounting to US$ 40
million which came to be under the control of and in the hands of Respondent No. 3
were completely covered and governed by said orders of restraint.
23. The memo dated 28.06.2016 filed by Respondent No. 10 in said O.A. No. 766 of
2013 annexed, ""Extract confirming payment of US$ (US Dollars) 40 Million to Defendant
No. 3 on 25.02.2016"". It is thus beyond any doubt that the payment of US$ 40Million
was received by Respondent No. 3 on 25.02.2016. These facts are admitted by
Respondent No. 3 in Paragraph 3 of his ""further counter affidavit"". The explanation that
the funds now stand transferred in favour of the trusts over which Respondent No. 3 has
no control at all, in fact aggravates the extent of violation. It is clear that the funds
which were in control of Respondent No. 3 have now been sought to be put beyond the
reach of processes of court, which is reflective of the intent.
2 4 . The applications moved by the Petitioners-banks on 02.03.2016 themselves had
made clear reference to the fact that as disclosed by Respondent Nos. 10 and 11 to
London Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange respectively Respondent No. 10
would pay to Respondent No. 3 a sum of US$75 million and accordingly Petitionersbanks
had moved four interlocutory applications for orders against Respondent Nos. 10
and 11 for disbursing said amount of US$ 75 million. The amount of US$ 40 Million so
received by Respondent No. 3 was therefore subject matter of the present controversy.
The least that was expected of Respondent No. 3 was to disclose relevant facts
pertaining to receipt and disbursement of US$ 40 million. The violation on that count is
thus not only against the directions issued by this Court but also against express
mandate of orders dated 03.09.2013 and 13.11.2013 passed in the proceedings in
question.
25. Having thus found that the actions on the part of Respondent No. 3 in disbursing
the amount of US$ 40 million was against the text and tenor of the orders passed by the
High Court of Karnataka, the question then arises whether this Court can take
cognizance of such violation or should it leave it to be decided by the High Court of
Karnataka itself in a properly instituted legal proceeding.
26. In Delhi Judicial Service Association, Tis Hazari Court, Delhi v. State of Gujarat and
Ors. MANU/SC/0478/1991 : (1991) 4 SCC 406, a question arose whether the power and
jurisdiction of this Court Under Article 129 of the Constitution is confined to ""the
contempt of this Court"" alone. Submissions advanced in that behalf were noted in
paragraph 14 of the judgment which sets out the submission of the learned Attorney
General:
...The Supreme Court as the Apex Court is the protector and guardian of justice
throughout the land, therefore, it has a right and also a duty to protect the
courts whose orders and judgments are amenable to correction, from
commission of contempt against them.
The subsequent paragraphs of the judgment namely paragraph 26 onwards show that
the contentions so advanced by the learned Attorney General were accepted by this
Court. It is true that the discussion was in the context of the contempt of a subordinate
court. However, the nature of power exercisable by this Court was considered in the
backdrop that this Court has supreme appellate jurisdiction over all courts and tribunals
in the country which is clear from the observations in paragraph 31 of the judgment.
We must say that Mr. Vaidyanathan did not seriously contend to the contrary but his
submission was that if the jurisdiction is so assumed and cognizance is taken by this
Court, Respondent No. 3 would lose one opportunity of having the matter assessed at
the level of the High Court. In our considered view, since we are dealing with the very
same cause in which the orders of restraint were passed by the High Court and since it
is coupled with the violation of orders of this Court as well, the matter can and ought to
be dealt with by this Court.
27. The record shows that by order dated 11.01.2017 the violation of those orders for
restraint passed by the High Court of Karnataka was taken note of by this Court and the
Counsel appearing for Respondent had sought time to file an appropriate reply.
However, no such reply was filed. Respondent No. 3 was thus put to clear notice about
the violation of those orders of restraints passed by the High Court of Karnataka. As
such, no prejudice has been caused or visited upon Respondent No. 3.
28. We find that the allegations against Respondent No. 3 of committing of contempt
are on two counts, in thata)
He is guilty of disobeying the Orders passed by this Court in not disclosing
full particulars of the assets as was directed by this Court.
b) He is guilty of violating the express Orders of Restraint passed by the High
Court of Karnataka in the same Cause from which the present proceedings have
arisen.
Though the contempt on the second count is theoretically of the orders passed by the
High Court of Karnataka since those orders pertain to the very same Cause and the
actions on part of Respondent No. 3 in not disclosing the account in question through
which the transfers were affected also fall with respect to contempt on first count, we
proceed to exercise our contempt jurisdiction even with regard to the second count. As
stated above, Respondent No. 3 was adequately put to notice and no prejudice has been
caused as a result of such assumption of jurisdiction by this Court.
2 9 . Having considered the entirety of the matter, we find that Respondent No. 3 is
guilty of having committed contempt of court on both the counts. At this stage it must
be stated that in terms of Rule 6 (1) of Rules to Regulate Proceeding for Contempt of
Supreme Court 1975, Respondent No. 3 was obliged and duty bound to appear in
person in response to the notice issued by this Court in Contempt Petition. Instead, he
chose to file application seeking recall of the orders issuing notice. Having considered
the matter, we see no reason to recall that order and dismiss I.A. Nos. 1 to 4 of 2016
preferred by Respondent No. 3 in Contempt Petition Civil No. 421-424 of 2016.
Respondent No. 3 is therefore duty bound to appear in person in the present contempt
proceedings.
30. Since Respondent No. 3 has not filed any reply to the Contempt Petition nor did he
appear in person, though we have found him guilty of having committed contempt of
court, we deem it necessary to give him one more opportunity and also hear him on the
proposed punishment. We therefore adjourn matter to 10.07.2017 for hearing
Respondent No. 3 in person on matters in issue including one regarding the proposed
punishment to be awarded to him for contempt of court. The instant contempt petitions
and connected cases shall now be listed at 2 o'clock on 10.07.2017. Respondent No. 3
may keep his affidavit ready to be tendered on the same day by stating mitigating
circumstances, if any and any other submissions he chooses to advance.
31. We direct the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, New Delhi to secure
and ensure presence of Respondent No. 3 before this Court on 10.07.2017. A copy of
this judgment be sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs for compliance.","Appellants: State Bank of India and Ors.

MERCANTILE LAWS, COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING BANKING - MATTERS
RELATING TO RECOVERY OF DEBTS/ BANK LOANS DUE UNDER THE BANKS AND
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
HIGH COURT Status:
Judgment challenged vide MANU/SC/0659/2020 dated: 31.08.2020
Facts:
The Petitioners-banks had advanced to Respondent No. 1 loans of thousands
of crores of rupees. Since the accounts were classified as non-performing
assets, the Petitioners-banks filed application against Respondent Nos. 1 to 9
before Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), inter alia seeking recovery from
Respondent Nos. 1 to 4. It was the case of the Petitioners-banks that despite
applications having been filed requiring Respondent Nos. 1 to 4 to disclose
details of their assets on oath, said Respondents never disclosed the assets
and instead, said Respondents secretly tried to dispose of their assets with an
intention to defeat the recovery proceedings pending before DRT. According to
the Petitioners-banks, Respondent Nos. 10 and 11 disclosed to London Stock
Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange respectively that Respondent No. 3
had resigned as Chairman of Respondent No. 11; that Respondent No. 10
would pay to Respondent No. 3 a sum of US$ 75 million; that out of said
amount a sum of US$ 40 million would be paid immediately; and that
Respondent No. 3 had made a statement to the press confirming said
transaction and had stated that he intended to settle in London. In these
circumstances, the Petitioners-banks moved four interlocutory applications
before DRT. The DRT failed to consider the other applications. Aggrieved by
such non-consideration, the Petitioners-banks moved the High Court by filing
petition seeking appropriate directions to DRT to hear and dispose of the
applications moved by the Petitioners-banks expeditiously. Since the High
Court refused to pass any ad interim direction, the special leave petitions
were filed in the present Court. The present Court granted time to file their
response. In the response filed by the Respondent No. 3, he shall disclose the
details of all his properties-movable, immovable, tangible, intangible,
shareholdings and any right, title or interest including beneficial interest and
those held in fiduciary capacity, in private trusts, public trusts, companies,
partnerships, limited liability partnerships, and/or any other entity/ies both
in India and abroad etc. in any form whatsoever and also the rights in the
name also of his wife and children. A counter affidavit was filed by
Respondent No. 3 disclosing his personal assets to the tune of Rs.
20,174,146,601, majority of which had been under attachment by the Income
Tax Department. The details of the assets of Respondent No. 3 situated
outside the country and those of his wife and children were furnished in a
sealed cover. The Respondent No. 10 filed a memo in application pending
before DRT along with two documents stating that an amount of US$ 40
million was paid to Respondent No. 3. Interlocutory applications were filed by
the Petitioners-banks stating that the disclosure statement made by
Respondent No. 3 and furnished to the Petitioners-banks was vague and
lacked in material particulars; that the location of the assets mentioned in
the statement was so unclear that it would be impossible for any person to
identify the location of the property; and that Respondent No. 3 had
undisputedly received a sum of US$ 40 million as disclosed in the memo but
there was no whisper about said amount in the disclosure statement. The
Petitioners-banks filed contempt petition submitting that appropriate
contempt proceedings be initiated for deliberate and willful violation of the
order passed by the present Court. Attention was invited to the restraint
orders passed by the High Court. It was submitted that the transfer of US$ 40
million by Respondent No. 3 to his children was not only in contempt of the
Orders passed by the High Court but was also an attempt to subvert the
Course of Justice by diverting the funds to shield them from ongoing recovery
proceedings.
Held:
(i) The orders passed by the present Court were clear and unambiguous and
Respondent No. 3 was called upon to make complete disclosure of his assets.
The assertion made by the Petitioners-banks that the details of the bank
account held in foreign Bank were never disclosed by Respondent No. 3 was
correct. No details of any bank account with overseas banks were given by
Respondent No. 3. The violation by Respondent No. 3 could not be termed as a
mere infraction. The violation by Respondent No. 3 regarding non-disclosure
became more pronounced because it was this very account which was utilized
to transmit funds. The orders passed by the High Court restrained the
concerned Respondents including Respondent No. 3. The orders of restraints
passed by the High Court were in the very same proceedings with which the
present Court was concerned. Said orders bound the concerned Respondents
including Respondent No. 3 and restrained them from transferring, alienating,
disposing or creating third party rights in respect of movable as well as
immovable properties belonging to them till further orders in the proceedings.
There was no ambiguity of any sort and the Orders of restraint were quite
clear. Consequently, funds amounting to US$ 40 million which came to be
under the control of and in the hands of Respondent No. 3 were completely
covered and governed by said orders of restraint. [21] and[22]
(ii) The amount of US$ 40 Million so received by Respondent No. 3 was
subject matter of the present controversy. The least that was expected of
Respondent No. 3 was to disclose relevant facts pertaining to receipt and
disbursement of US$ 40 million. The actions on the part of Respondent No. 3
in disbursing the amount of US$ 40 million was against the text and tenor of
the orders passed by the High Court. [24] and[25]
(iii) Respondent No. 3 was put to clear notice about the violation of those
orders of restraints passed by the High Court. As such, no prejudice was
caused or visited upon Respondent No. 3. Respondent No. 3 was guilty of
having committed contempt of court. Respondent No. 3 was obliged and duty
bound to appear in person in response to the notice issued by the present
Court in Contempt Petition. Instead, he chose to file application seeking recall
of the orders issuing notice. Respondent No. 3 was duty bound to appear in
person in the present contempt proceedings. [27] and[29]
(iv) Respondent No. 3 was given one more opportunity. The matter was
adjourned for hearing Respondent No. 3 in person on matters in issue
including one regarding the proposed punishment to be awarded to him for
contempt of court. [30]",,,,
"Ranjan Gogoi, J.
1. Leave granted.
2 . The writ petition out of which these appeals have arisen was instituted before the
Agartala Bench of the Gauhati High Court. The writ Petitioners, who are the
Respondents herein, are members of Scheduled Tribe(s) of the State of Tripura. They
had contended that the Sale Notification dated 26.06.2012 issued by the Appellant Bank
under the provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and
Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the ""Act of 2002"")
was in infraction of Section 187 of the Tripura Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act,
1960 (hereinafter referred to as the ""Tripura Act of 1960"") as under the Tripura Act
there is a legislative embargo on the sale of mortgaged properties by the bank to any
person who is not a member of a scheduled tribe. The auction purchasers in the present
case happened to be the persons who are not members of any scheduled tribe.
3 . The High Court by the impugned order answered the writ petition in favour of the
Respondents/writ Petitioners on the ground that the Tripura Act of 1960 being included
in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution and, therefore, enjoying the protection of
Section 31B of the Constitution, would prevail over the Act of 2002 so as to invalidate
the sale Notification dated 26.06.2012, the same being contrary to the provisions of
Section 187 of the Tripura Act of 1960.
4. It will not require much appreciation or scrutiny to come to the conclusion that the
High Court was wholly incorrect in answering the writ petition and striking down the
sale Notification dated 26.06.2012 on the above basis. Article 31B of the Constitution,
on the very face of the language contained therein, is self explanatory and provides
protection/immunity to a legislation from challenge on the ground that it violates any of
the provisions of Part III of the Constitution. Inclusion of the Tripura Act of 1960 in the
Ninth Schedule by itself, would, therefore, not confer immunity to the said legislation
from being overridden by the provisions of a Parliamentary statute. This is a question,
therefore, that this Court will have to deal with notwithstanding the fact that the
proceedings before the High Court did not proceed on the aforesaid basis. We had,
therefore, permitted the learned Counsels of both sides to address us on the core
question arising in the present appeals, namely, whether the Act of 2002 insofar as it
provides for sale of immovable properties offered as security for a loan advanced,
without any restriction as to the class or category of buyers, would prevail
notwithstanding the restrictive provision in this regard Under Section 187 of the Tripura
Act of 1960.
5. Shri Mukul Rohatgi, the learned Attorney General for India appearing on behalf of the
Appellant-Bank and Shri V. Giri, learned senior Counsel representing the auctionpurchasers
in the connected appeal have contended that the purpose and object of the
Act of 2002 is to regulate securitisation and reconstruction of financial assets and
enforcement of security interest and for matters connected therewith. On the other
hand, the purpose of the Tripura Act of 1960 is to consolidate the law relating to land
revenue and to provide for the acquisition of estates and for certain other measures of
land reform. While the Act of 2002 enacted by the Union Parliament is referable to Entry
45 of List I, the Tripura Act can be traced to Entries 18 and 45 of the State List. Section
187 of the Tripura Act puts an embargo on the sale of hypothecated/mortgaged
properties by a bank to any person who is not a tribal. Therefore, the provisions of the
Tripura Act of 1960 deal with a crucial aspect of the subject of banking. Reference in
this regard is made to the provision of Section 13 of the Act of 2002 which permits the
secured creditor to enforce the security interest without the intervention of the Court.
The sale of the property of any person, offered to a bank as security for any financial
facility, so as to recover the dues of the Bank is a part of the core banking activity of
any bank. The dominant legislation so far as banking is concerned, in the present case,
is the Act of 2002 enacted by the Union Parliament and not the State Act. On the said
basis, it is contended that by virtue of Article 246(1) of the Constitution, the Act of
2002, so far as sale of mortgaged properties by the bank is concerned, would prevail
over Section 187 of the Tripura Act of 1960. The said provisions of the State Act must
give way to the provisions of the Central Act, it is urged.
6. Learned Counsels for the Respondents/writ Petitioners, in reply, have contended that
the provisions of both the statutes can co-exist and run parallelly without any conflict.
It is urged that, in fact, there is no conflict between the two. Section 187 of the Tripura
Act of 1960 does not prohibit or impose a complete embargo on the sale of mortgaged
properties. Only when the borrower is a tribal the sale by the Bank has also to be to a
tribal.
7. Repugnancy or inconsistency between the provisions of Central and State enactments
can occur in two situations. The first, in case of a Central and a State Act on any field of
entry mentioned in List III of the Seventh Schedule (Concurrent List). To such a
situation of repugnancy or inconsistency, the provisions of Article 254 of the
Constitution would apply. If there is such an inconsistency, Article 254(1) makes it very
clear that the central law will prevail subject, however, to the provisions of Article
254(2) and further subject to proviso to Article 254(2). The above position would be
clear from the opinion rendered by a three Judges Bench of this Court in M/s. Hoechst
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Ors. v. State of Bihar and Ors. MANU/SC/0392/1983 :
(1983) 4 SCC 45 Para 67 of the aforesaid opinion which may be usefully noticed is in
the following terms:
67. Article 254 of the Constitution makes provision first, as to what would
happen in the case of conflict between a Central and State law with regard to
the subjects enumerated in the Concurrent List, and secondly, for resolving
such conflict. Article 254(1) enunciates the normal Rule that in the event of a
conflict between a Union and a State law in the concurrent field, the former
prevails over the latter. Clause (1) lays down that if a State law relating to a
concurrent subject is 'repugnant' to a Union law relating to that subject, then,
whether the Union law is prior or later in time, the Union law will prevail and
the State law shall, to the extent of such repugnancy, be void. To the general
Rule laid down in Clause (1), Clause (2) engrafts an exception viz., that if the
President assents to a State law which has been reserved for his consideration,
it will prevail notwithstanding its repugnancy to an earlier law of the Union,
both laws dealing with a concurrent subject. In such a case, the Central Act,
will give way to the State Act only to the extent of inconsistency between the
two, and no more. In short, the result of obtaining the assent of the President
to a State Act which is inconsistent with a previous Union law relating to a
concurrent subject would be that the State Act will prevail in that State and
override the provisions of the Central Act in their applicability to that State
only. The predominance of the State law may however be taken away if
Parliament legislates under the proviso to Clause (2). The proviso to Article
254(2) empowers the Union Parliament to repeal or amend a repugnant State
law, either directly, or by itself enacting a law repugnant to the State law with
respect to the 'same matter'. Even though the subsequent law made by
Parliament does not expressly repeal a State law, even then, the State law will
become void as soon as the subsequent law of Parliament creating repugnancy
is made. A State law would be repugnant to the Union law when there is direct
conflict between the two laws. Such repugnancy may also arise where both
laws operate in the same field and the two cannot possibly stand together: See
Zaverbhai Amaidas v. State of Bombay MANU/SC/0040/1954 : (1955) 1 SCR
799; M. Karunanidhi v. Union of India MANU/SC/0159/1979 : (1979) 3 SCR 254
and T. Barai v. Henry Ah Hoe MANU/SC/0123/1982 : (1983) 1 SCC 177.
8. The above view has been reiterated in State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd.
and Ors. MANU/SC/0038/2004 : (2004) 10 SCC 201 There are several other
pronouncements of this Court on the aforesaid issue. The same, however, would not
require any mention as any such reference would be only a multiplication of discussions
on what appears to be a settled issue. In the present case, however, the question before
this Court is not one of repugnancy between a Central and a State law relatable to an
Entry in List III (Concurrent List). No further attention to the above aspect of the matter
would, therefore, be required.
9 . The second situation of repugnancy or inconsistency as in the present case is
between to a subsequent Central law (Act of 2002) covered by Entry 45 of List I and an
earlier State law (Tripura Act of 1960) relatable to Entries 18 and 45 of List II. How
such a situation is to be resolved and answered and which legislation would have
primacy is the moot question that arises for consideration in the present appeals.
10. Article 246 of the Constitution of India is in the following terms.
246. Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and by the
Legislatures of States:
(1) Notwithstanding anything in Clauses (2) and (3), Parliament has exclusive
power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in
the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the 'Union List')
(2) Notwithstanding anything in Clause (3), Parliament and, subject to Clause
(1), the Legislature of any State also, have power to make laws with respect to
any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule (in this
Constitution referred to as the 'Concurrent List')
(3) Subject to Clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State has exclusive
power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of
the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution
referred to as the 'State List')
(4) Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part
of the territory of India not included (in a State) notwithstanding that such
matter is a matter enumerated in the State List.
11. In interpreting Article 246 regard must be had to the constitutional scheme which
visualises a federal structure giving full autonomy to the Union Parliament as well as to
the State legislatures in their respective/demarcated fields of legislation. The problem
may, however, become a little more complex than what may seemingly appear as the
two legislations may very well be within the respective domains of the concerned
legislatures and, yet, there may be intrusion into areas that fall beyond the assigned
fields of legislation. In such a situation it will be plain duty of the Constitutional Court
to see if the conflict can be resolved by acknowledging the mutual existence of the two
legislations. If that is not possible, then by virtue of the provisions of Article 246(1),
the Parliamentary legislation would prevail and the State legislation will have to give
way notwithstanding the fact that the State legislation is within the demarcated field
(List II). This is the principle of federal supremacy which Article 246 of the Constitution
embodies. The said principle will, however, prevail provided the pre-condition exists,
namely, the Parliamentary legislation is the dominant legislation and the State
legislation, though within its own field, has the effect of encroaching on a vital sphere
of the subject or entry to which the dominant legislation is referable. This is the
principle that is discernible from the Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in State
of West Bengal and Ors. v. Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights,
West Bengal and Ors. MANU/SC/0121/2010 : (2010) 3 SCC 571 Paragraphs 25, 26
and 27 which illuminates the issue may be conveniently extracted below.
25. The non obstante Clause in Article 246(1) contemplates the predominance
or supremacy of the Union Legislature. This power is not encumbered by
anything contained in Clauses (2) and (3) for these clauses themselves are
expressly limited and made subject to the non obstante Clause in Article
246(1). The State Legislature has exclusive power to make laws for such State
or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in
the Seventh Schedule and it also has the power to make laws with respect to
any matters enumerated in List III (Concurrent List). The exclusive power of the
State Legislature to legislate with respect to any of the matters enumerated in
List II has to be exercised subject to Clause (1) i.e. the exclusive power of
Parliament to legislate with respect to matters enumerated in List I. As a
consequence, if there is a conflict between an entry in List I and an entry in List
II, which is not capable of reconciliation, the power of Parliament to legislate
with respect to a matter enumerated in List II must supersede pro tanto the
exercise of power of the State Legislature.
26. Both Parliament and the State Legislature have concurrent powers of
legislation with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III. The words
""notwithstanding anything contained in Clauses (2) and (3)"" in Article 246(1)
and the words ""subject to Clauses (1) and (2)"" in Article 246(3) lay down the
principle of federal supremacy viz. that in case of inevitable conflict between
the Union and State powers, the Union power as enumerated in List I shall
prevail over the State power as enumerated in Lists II and III and in case of an
overlapping between Lists II and III, the latter shall prevail.
27. Though, undoubtedly, the Constitution exhibits supremacy of Parliament
over the State Legislatures, yet the principle of federal supremacy laid down in
Article 246 of the Constitution cannot be resorted to unless there is an
irreconcilable direct conflict between the entries in the Union and the State
Lists. Thus, there is no quarrel with the broad proposition that under the
Constitution there is a clear demarcation of legislative powers between the
Union and the States and they have to confine themselves within the field
entrusted to them. It may also be borne in mind that the function of the lists is
not to confer powers; they merely demarcate the legislative field....
12. Equally illuminating is the view available in the opinion of this Court rendered In
Re. Special Reference No. 1 of 2001 (2004) 4 SCC 489, which is reproduced below.
13. The Constitution of India delineates the contours of the powers enjoyed by
the State Legislature and Parliament in respect of various subjects enumerated
in the Seventh Schedule. The Rules relating to distribution of powers are to be
gathered from the various provisions contained in Part XI and the legislative
heads mentioned in the three lists of the Schedule. The legislative powers of
both the Union and State Legislatures are given in precise terms. Entries in the
lists are themselves not powers of legislation, but fields of legislation.
However, an entry in one list cannot be so interpreted as to make it cancel or
obliterate another entry or make another entry meaningless. In case of apparent
conflict, it is the duty of the court to iron out the crease and avoid conflict by
reconciling the conflict. If any entry overlaps or is in apparent conflict with
another entry, every attempt shall be made to harmonise the same.
14. When the question arose about reconciling Entry 45 of List I, duties of
excise, and Entry 18 of List II, taxes on the sale of goods, of the Government of
India Act, 1935, Sir Maurice Gwyer, C.J. in Central Provinces and Berar Act No.
XIV of 1938, In re, (1939) FCR 18, at pp. 42-44 observed:
A grant of the power in general terms, standing by itself, would no
doubt be construed in the wider sense, but it may be qualified by other
express provisions in the same enactment, by the implications of the
context, and even by considerations arising out of what appears to be
the general scheme of the Act.
It was further observed:
An endeavour must be made to solve it, as the Judicial Committee have
said, by having recourse to the context and scheme of the Act, and a
reconciliation attempted between two apparently conflicting
jurisdictions by reading the two entries together and by interpreting,
and, where necessary modifying the language of the one by that of the
other. If indeed such a reconciliation should prove impossible, then,
and only then, will the non obstante Clause operate and the federal
power prevail;
15. Although Parliament cannot legislate on any of the entries in the State List,
it may do so incidentally while essentially dealing with the subject coming
within the purview of the entry in the Union List. Conversely, the State
Legislature also while making legislation may incidentally trench upon the
subject covered in the Union List. Such incidental encroachment in either event
need not make the legislation ultra vires the Constitution. The doctrine of pith
and substance is sometimes invoked to find out the nature and content of the
legislation. However, when there is an irreconcilable conflict between the two
legislations, the Central legislation shall prevail. However, every attempt would
be made to reconcile the conflict.
13. The federal structure under the constitutional scheme can also work to nullify an
incidental encroachment made by the Parliamentary legislation on a subject of a State
legislation where the dominant legislation is the State legislation. An attempt to keep
the aforesaid constitutional balance intact and give a limited operation to the doctrine of
federal supremacy can be discerned in the concurring judgment of Ruma Pal, J. in ITC
Ltd. v. Agricultural Produce Market Committee and Ors. MANU/SC/0047/2002 :
(2002) 9 SCC 232, wherein after quoting the observations of this Court in the case of
S.R. Bomai v. Union of India MANU/SC/0444/1994 : (1994) 3 SCC 1 (para 276), the
learned Judge has gone to observe as follows (para 94 of the report):
276. The fact that under the scheme of our Constitution, greater power is
conferred upon the Centre vis-Ã -vis the States does not mean that States are
mere appendages of the Centre. Within the sphere allotted to them, States are
supreme. The Centre cannot tamper with their powers. More particularly, the
courts should not adopt an approach, an interpretation, which has the effect of
or tends to have the effect of whittling down the powers reserved to the States.
94. Although Parliament cannot legislate on any of the entries in the State List,
it may do so incidentally while essentially legislating within the entries under
the Union List. Conversely, the State Legislatures may encroach on the Union
List, when such an encroachment is merely ancillary to an exercise of power
intrinsically under the State List. The fact of encroachment does not affect the
vires of the law even as regards the area of encroachment. [A.S. Krishna v.
State of Madras MANU/SC/0035/1956 : AIR 1957 SC 297; Chaturbhai M. Patel
v. Union of India MANU/SC/0012/1959 : (1960) 2 SCR 362; State of Rajasthan
v. G. Chawla MANU/SC/0141/1958 : AIR 1959 SC 544; Ishwari Khetan Sugar
Mills (P) Ltd. v. State of U.P. MANU/SC/0069/1980 : (1980) 4 SCC 136]. This
principle commonly known as the doctrine of pith and substance, does not
amount to an extension of the legislative fields. Therefore, such incidental
encroachment in either event does not deprive the State Legislature in the first
case or Parliament in the second, of their exclusive powers under the entry so
encroached upon. In the event the incidental encroachment conflicts with
legislation actually enacted by the dominant power, the dominant legislation
will prevail.
1 4 . The aforesaid view in the concurring judgment of Ruma Pal, J. in ITC Ltd. v.
Agricultural Produce Market Committee and Ors. (supra), seems to have been
echoed in a recent pronouncement of this Court in Vishal N. Kalsaria v. Bank of
India and Ors. MANU/SC/0061/2016 : (2016) 3 SCC 762, wherein this Court had held
that the provisions of the Act of 2002 will not have an overriding effect on the
provisions of the State Rent Control Acts.
15. In the present case the conflict between the Central and the State Act is on account
of an apparent overstepping by the provisions of the State Act dealing with land reform
into an area of banking covered by the Central Act. The test, therefore, would be to find
out as to which is the dominant legislation having regard the area of encroachment.
1 6 . The provisions of the Act of 2002 enable the bank to take possession of any
property where a security interest has been created in its favour. Specifically, Section
13 of the 2002 Act enables the bank to take possession of and sell such property to any
person to realise its dues. The purchaser of such property acquires a clear title to the
property sold, subject to compliance with the requirements prescribed.
17. Section 187 of the Tripura Act of 1960, on the other hand, prohibits the bank from
transferring the property which has been mortgaged by a member of a scheduled tribe
to any person other than a member of a scheduled tribe. This is a clear restriction on
what is permitted by the Act of 2002 for the realisation of amounts due to the bank.
18. The Act of 2002 is relatable to the Entry of banking which is included in List I of the
Seventh Schedule. Sale of mortgaged property by a bank is an inseparable and integral
part of the business of banking. The object of the State Act, as already noted, is an
attempt to consolidate the land revenue law in the State and also to provide measures
of agrarian reforms. The field of encroachment made by the State legislature is in the
area of banking. So long there did not exist any parallel Central Act dealing with sale of
secured assets and referable to Entry 45 of List I, the State Act, including Section 187,
operated validly. However, the moment Parliament stepped in by enacting such a law
traceable to Entry 45 and dealing exclusively with activities relating to sale of secured
assets, the State law, to the extent that it is inconsistent with the Act of 2002, must give
way. The dominant legislation being the Parliamentary legislation, the provisions of the
Tripura Act of 1960, pro tanto, (Section 187) would be invalid. It is the provisions of
the Act of 2002, which do not contain any embargo on the category of persons to whom
mortgaged property can be sold by the bank for realisation of its dues that will prevail
over the provisions contained in Section 187 of the Tripura Act of 1960.
19. The decision of this Court in Central Bank of India v. State of Kerala and Ors.
MANU/SC/0306/2009 : (2009) 4 SCC 94, holding that the provisions of the Bombay
Sales Tax Act, 1959 and the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963 providing for a first
charge on the property of the person liable to pay sales tax, in favour of the State, is
not inconsistent with the provisions contained in the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks
and Financial Institutions, Act 1993 (for short the ""DRT Act"") and also the Act of 2002
must be understood by noticing the absence of any specific provision in either of the
Central enactments containing a similar/parallel provision of a first charge in favour of
the bank. The judgment of this Court holding the State enactments to be valid and the
Central enactments not to have any overriding effect, proceeds on the said basis i.e.
absence of any provision creating a first charge in favour of the bank in either of the
Central enactments.
20. The High Court in the judgment under challenge has also taken the view that the
impugned sale Notification dated 26.06.2012 is invalid for infraction of Rule 5 and Rule
8(5) of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002, in as much as the bank did not
obtain any valuation report of the property before resorting to the impugned auction
sale. The Rules in question read as follows.
5. Valuation of movable secured assets.-
After taking possession under Sub-rule (1) of Rule 4 and in any case
before sale, the authorised officer shall obtain the estimated value of
the movable secured assets and thereafter, if considered necessary, fix
in consultation with the secured creditor, the reserve price of the assets
to be sold in realisation of the dues of the secured creditor.
8. Sale of immovable secured assets.-
(5) Before effecting sale of the immovable property referred to in Subrule
(1) of Rule 9, the authorised officer shall obtain valuation of the
property from an approved valuer and in consultation with the secured
creditor, fix the reserve price of the property and may sell the whole or
any part of such immovable secured asset by any of the following
methods:
21. Our attention had been specifically drawn to the stand of the Appellant-Bank before
the High Court in the counter filed (paragraph 20). Taking into account the averments
made in the said affidavit, we find that the sale proclamation had mentioned a reserve
price of Rs. 275 lacs and the property had been actually sold by auction at Rs. 416 lacs.
That apart, the valuation report dated 14.06.2012 of the approved valuer valuing the
property at Rs. 341.15 lacs has also been placed before us by way of an additional
document which we are inclined to take on record. The requirements under Rule 5 and
Rule 8(5) have, therefore, been complied with and the sale proclamation and the sale
effected pursuant thereto cannot be invalidated on the above ground.
22. For the aforesaid reasons, the impugned order passed by the High Court has to be
set aside which we hereby do. The appeals are consequently allowed. There will,
however, be no order as to costs.","Appellants: UCO Bank and Ors.

Case Category:
MERCANTILE LAWS, COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING BANKING - MATTERS
RELATING TO SECURITISATION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND
REINFORCEMENT OF SECURITY INTEREST ACT, 2002
Facts:
The petition was instituted before the High Court. The
Petitioners/Respondents were members of Scheduled Tribe(s) of the State.
They had contended that the Sale Notification issued by the Appellant Bank
under the provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial
Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 was in infraction of
Section 187 of the Tripura Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960 as
under the Act, 1960 there is a legislative embargo on the sale of mortgaged
properties by the bank to any person who is not a member of a scheduled
tribe. The auction purchasers happened to be the persons who are not
members of any scheduled tribe. The High Court answered the petition in
favour of the Respondents on the ground that the Act, 1960 being included in
the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution and, therefore, enjoying the protection
of Section 31B of the Constitution, would prevail over the Act, 2002 so as to
invalidate the Sale Notification, the same being contrary to the provisions of
Section 187 of the Act, 1960. Hence, the present appeal.
Held, while allowing the appeal:
(i) Repugnancy or inconsistency between the provisions of Central and State
enactments can occur in two situations. The first, in case of a Central and a
State Act on any field of entry mentioned in List III of the Seventh Schedule
(Concurrent List). The second situation of repugnancy or inconsistency as in
the present case is between to a subsequent Central law/Act, 2002 covered
by Entry 45 of List I and an earlier State law/Act, 1960) relatable to Entries
18 and 45 of List II. [7] and[9]
(ii) The conflict between the Central and the State Act is on account of an
apparent overstepping by the provisions of the State Act dealing with land
reform into an area of banking covered by the Central Act. The test, therefore,
would be to find out as to which is the dominant legislation having regard the
area of encroachment. [15]
(iii) The provisions of the Act, 2002 enable the bank to take possession of any
property where a security interest has been created in its favour. Specifically,
Section 13 of the Act, 2002 enables the bank to take possession of and sell
such property to any person to realise its dues. The purchaser of such property
acquires a clear title to the property sold, subject to compliance with the
requirements prescribed. Section 187 of the Act, 1960, on the other hand,
prohibits the bank from transferring the property which has been mortgaged
by a member of a scheduled tribe to any person other than a member of a
scheduled tribe. This is a clear restriction on what is permitted by the Act,
2002 for the realisation of amounts due to the bank. [16] and[17]
(iv) The moment Parliament stepped in by enacting such a law traceable to
Entry 45 and dealing exclusively with activities relating to sale of secured
assets, the State law, to the extent that it is inconsistent with the Act, 2002,
must give way. The dominant legislation being the Parliamentary legislation,
the provisions of the Act, 1960, pro tanto, Section 187 would be invalid. It is
the provisions of the Act, 2002, which do not contain any embargo on the
category of persons to whom mortgaged property can be sold by the bank for
realisation of its dues that will prevail over the provisions contained in
Section 187 of the Act, 1960. [18]
(v) The property was sold by auction at higher rate compare to reserve price
mentioned in sale proclamation. That apart, the valuation report of the
approved valuer valuing the property was also been placed. The requirements
under Rule 5 and Rule 8(5) of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules,
2002 were complied with and the sale proclamation and the sale effected
pursuant thereto could not be invalidated. The impugned order passed by the
High Court was set aside. [22]",,,,
"Jasti Chelameswar, J.
1. Leave Granted
2 . M/s. Norton Granites & Spinners (P) Ltd. (hereafter NORTON) sold three parcels of
land by three separate registered sale deeds dated 14.5.2007 to one M/s. Srivari
Exports, a partnership firm (hereafter FIRM). The Appellant herein is the managing
partner of the FIRM and the Respondent, it appears, is the power of attorney holder for
the managing director of NORTON. It appears from the record that the Appellant is also
a director of a company known as M/s. Dakshin Granites Pvt. Ltd. (hereafter DAKSHIN).
3. The Respondent herein filed a complaint on 08.10.2012 bearing CC No. 2925 of 2012
on the file of the VII Metropolitan Magistrate, George Town at Chennai against the
Appellant herein invoking Sections 138 and 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881
(hereinafter referred to as ""THE ACT""). The substance of the complaint is that the
Appellant herein drew a cheque bearing No. 064159 dated 10.8.2012 for a sum of Rs.
39 lakhs (Rs. 39,00,000/-) on the Syndicate Bank, Armenian Street, Chennai in favour
of the Respondent. According to the complaint, the said amount of Rs. 39 lakhs is the
amount due from the Appellant towards the balance of the sale consideration in
connection with the sale transactions referred to above.
4 . The said cheque was presented for collection by the Respondent through his bank
(Indian Bank, High Court Branch, Chennai) on 28.8.2012 which was dishonoured on the
ground that the account on which the cheque was drawn had been closed.
5. On 10.9.2012, the Respondent issued a notice contemplated under Clause (b) of the
proviso to Section 138 of THE ACT. By the said notice, the Appellant was informed that
the cheque had been dishonored and further the Appellant was called upon to pay the
sum of Rs. 39 lakhs within 15 days from the date of the receipt of the notice. According
to the complaint, the notice was served on the Petitioner on 14.9.2012 but the Petitioner
neither responded to the notice nor made the payment. Hence the complaint.
6 . On 19.8.2015, Crl.M.P. No. 6771 of 2015 came to be filed in the above-mentioned
CC No. 2925 of 2012 by the Respondent herein purporting to be an application Under
Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short ""CrPC"") with prayer as
follows:
3 . In the above circumstances, it is therefore prayed that this Hon'ble Court
may be pleased to implead M/s. DAKSHIN GRANITES PVT. LTD., No. 3B,
EEBROS Centre, 40, Montieth Road, Chennai - 600 008 as Accused A1, in C.C.
No. 2925 of 2012 pending on the file of this Hon'ble Court and thus render
justice.
7. According to the said application, it came to the notice of the Respondent during the
course of cross-examination of the Appellant herein at the trial of the CC No. 2925 of
2012 that the cheque in question was drawn on the account of DAKSHIN and the
Appellant is only a signatory on behalf of the DAKSHIN in his capacity as a Director of
DAKSHIN. The Respondent had initially failed to lodge the complaint against DAKSHIN
by inadvertence and hence the application.
8. The application was contested by the Appellant. The learned Metropolitan Magistrate
by his Order dated 21.4.2016 allowed the said application. The Petitioner carried the
matter in Criminal R.C. No. 774 of 2016 to the Madras High Court unsuccessfully. Hence
the instant SLP.
9. Xerox copies of the three sale deeds are placed before us and according to the said
documents, the sale consideration for the three sale deeds is Rs. 2,80,000/-, Rs.
2,50,000/- and Rs. 1,20,000/-, in all Rs. 6,50,000/-. Nonetheless, the Respondent filed
the complaint stating that the cheque in question for Rs. 39 lakhs was drawn towards
the balance of the sale consideration of the transactions covered by the abovementioned
three sale deeds. Prima facie, it is very doubtful whether the cheque was
drawn for any amount which is legally due to the Respondent from the Appellant.
10. A xerox copy of the cheque is placed before us. The number of the account on
which the cheque was drawn is not very clear from the said copy. But from the content
of the application from out of which the instant appeal arises and from the xerox copy
of the cheque it appears that it was drawn on the account of DAKSHIN by somebody
who claims to be a Director of DAKSHIN. It is a case of the Respondent that the cheque
was signed by the Appellant. There appears to be some dispute regarding the identity of
the person who signed the cheque. It can be seen from para 2 of the complaint, the said
cheque was handed over to the Respondent through ""an unknown person at Chennai
High Court premises"".
11. Assuming for the sake of argument that an amount of Rs. 39 lakhs was due towards
the balance of the sale consideration of the above-mentioned three sales from the FIRM
of which the Appellant is said to be the Managing Partner. The cheque in question was
drawn by a private company (DAKSHIN) (a third party to the sale transactions and such
a payment is permissible under the Indian Contract Act) and allegedly signed by the
Appellant in his capacity as the Director of DAKSHIN.
12. The learned Counsel for the Appellant argued;
(a) Since the cheque in question was drawn on the account of DAKSHIN, the
person primarily liable for punishment Under Section 138 of THE ACT would be
DAKSHIN. The Appellant herein being the alleged signatory in his capacity as
the Director of DAKSHIN would only be vicariously liable (if at all) for the
offence committed by DAKSHIN. In view of the law declared by this Court in
Aneeta Hada1 the prosecution against the Appellant could not be successfully
maintained without prosecuting DAKSHIN. Since the complaint was originally
lodged only against the Appellant, the Respondent resorted to the device of
filing an application on 19.8.2015 Under Section 319 Code of Criminal
Procedure to 'implead' (in substance summon) DAKSHIN as an
Accused/Respondent to the complaint.
(b) Section 142(1)(a) of THE ACT inter alia stipulates that a complaint
regarding the commission of the offence Under Section 138 must be ""made
within one month of the date on which the cause of action arises under Clause
(c) of the proviso to Section 138"". The application Under Section 319 of Code
of Criminal Procedure by which DAKSHIN is sought to be impleaded
(summoned) is in substance a complaint against DAKSHIN which is filed some
three years after the expiry of the period of 15 days stipulated under Clause (c)
of the proviso to Section 138. Therefore barred by the stipulation contained in
Section 141(1)(b) of THE ACT. No valid explanation for condoning such a long
delay is offered by the Respondent. Both the courts below erred in coming to
the conclusion that once the offence is taken cognizance of, the question of
delay does not arise.
(c) Section 1382 stipulates inter alia that (i) the payee of the cheque must give
a notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque within 30 days from the ""receipt
of the information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as
unpaid""; (ii) the notice must contain a demand for the payment of the amount
due on the cheque; and (iii) upon the receipt of the notice, if the drawer of the
cheque fails to make payment within 15 days of the receipt of the notice,
prosecution could be launched within one month thereafter. The timelines
stipulated under Clauses (a) to (c) of the proviso to Section 138 are
mandatory.3
(d) The (instant) application Under Section 319 Code of Criminal Procedure
came to be filed (on 19.08.2015) some three years after the dishonour of the
cheque by the bank (on 30.8.2012). If the Respondent were to file complaint
Under Section 138 against DAKSHIN on 19.8.2015, such a complaint would be
clearly not maintainable as it would have been far beyond the permissible time
within which a complaint could have been filed Under Section 138 of THE ACT.
Therefore, both the courts below erred in allowing the application.
13. On the other hand, the learned Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the trial
court and the High Court rightly impleaded the Appellant. The learned Counsel
submitted that the proviso to Clause (b) of Section 142 of THE ACT enables the Court to
take cognizance of the offence even beyond the prescribed period of limitation, if the
complainant satisfies the Court that he had sufficient cause for not making the
complaint within the period of limitation. The Respondent only got to know that the
cheque in question was drawn on the account of DAKSHIN only during the course of
trial. Therefore, the Respondent made out a case for condonation of the delay.
14. It is rather difficult to understand the decision of the trial court. We are given to
understand that the order is made in vernacular and only a translated copy4 of the same
is placed before us. Be that as it may, the 'relevant' portion of the translated copies
reads as follows:
Hence whether cheque was drawn by company trial on the complaint can be
possible only if company is impleaded in complaint.
Hence as far as this case on hand, without impleading Dakshin Granite (P) Ltd.
trial can not be conducted for impleading the company and conditions as per
Section 138 should be fulfilled. As per Section 138 Notice has been sent to
Dakshin Granites - hence conditions fulfilled.
It is prayed by complainant that he should be permitted to implead company
and also condone the delay.
As per Section 142, complaint is to be filed with one month which has been
done. Hence as per Section 142(b) no separate petition is required after
cognizance of offence.
The offenders of crime can be decided. To take cognisance it is not required to
take cognizance in the case of each Accused.
In view of the above the petition is allowed and I order for impleading the
company and summons to be served.
15. While examining the legality of the trial court's order, the High Court took note of
the fact that two applications were filed by the Respondent, one to condone the delay
(of 1211 days) and other to implead (summon?) DAKSHIN invoking Section 319 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure. The High Court recorded an interesting finding:
In this case, the present revision is preferred only against the order passed in
Crl.M.P. No. 6771 of 2015 in C.C. No. 2925 of 2012, which was filed to implead
M/s. Dakshin Granites Private Ltd., as an Accused in the private complaint and
no appeal or revision was preferred against the order passed in Crl.M.P. No.
1257 of 2016 by either side.
16. We say it is an interesting finding because from the translation of the trial court's
order placed before us, the trial court is silent about the application for condonation of
the delay. On the other hand, the trial court observed ""Hence as per Section 142(b) no
separate petition is required after cognizance of offence.""
After recording such a finding, the High Court proceeded to say;
...The Trial Court, after considering the arguments of both sides, came
to a conclusion that since the case was already taken on file and
cognizance of the offence was taken, in this case, separate petition to
condone the delay of 1211 days is not necessary and M/s. Dakshin
Granites Private Ltd. was impleaded as an Accused. Admittedly,
statutory notice Under Section 138(b) of the Negotiable Instruments
Act was issued to M/s. Dakshin Granites Private Ltd., and M/s. Dakshin
Granites Private Ltd., has not preferred any revision before this Court.
Hence, the present Petitioner is only the signatory. Even according to
the present Petitioner, who is an individual person and who signed the
cheque represents the company.
The High Court, concluded that as no revision is filed by DAKSHIN the ""revision
preferred by the Petitioner is not maintainable. No merits in the petition.""
17. We are of the opinion that it is difficult to understand the conclusions recorded by
both the courts below. They are wholly illogical, to use a very mild expression.
18. Section 142 of THE ACT inter alia stipulates that no court shall take cognizance of
any offence punishable Under Section 138 unless a complaint is made within one month
of the date on which the cause of action arises under Clause (c) of the proviso to
Section 138. The relevant portion of Section 142 reads as follows:
142 Cognizance of offences. -Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973-
(a) no court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable Under
Section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or,
as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque;
(b) such complaint is made within one month of the date on which the
cause of action arises under Clause (c) of the proviso to Section 138:
Provided that the cognizance of a complaint may be taken by the Court
after the prescribed period, if the complainant satisfies the Court that
he had sufficient cause for not making a complaint within such period.
19. The preliminary facts constituting an offence5 Under Section 138 of the Act are; (i)
that a cheque is drawn, and (ii) that cheque is dishonored by the Bank when presented
by the payee. Under the scheme of Section 138 both the drawer of the cheque and the
bank upon which the cheque is drawn are parties against whom the payee of the cheque
can have various legal rights, which may have either civil or criminal consequences or
perhaps both depending upon the facts of a given case. Section 138 prescribes only one
of the consequences, i.e. the prosecution and punishment of only the drawer of the
cheque. It is possible in a given case that a bank may without any valid justification
decline to honor a cheque drawn on it. For which act of the bank, the drawer of the
cheque may in no way be responsible either in fact or in law. In such a fact situation,
the payee of the cheque may have legal rights and remedies for the redressal of the
injury (if any) caused by the Bank in addition to his rights against the drawer of the
cheque.
20. The offence Under Section 138 of THE ACT is capable of being committed only by
the drawer of the cheque. The logic of the High Court that since the offence is already
taken cognizance of, there is no need to take cognizance of the offence against
DAKSHIN is flawed. Section 141 stipulates the liability for the offence punishable Under
Section 138 of THE ACT when the person committing such an offence happens to be a
company-in other words when the drawer of the cheque happens to be a company.
Relevant portion of Section 141 reads as follows:
Section 141. Offences by companies.-
(1) If the person committing an offence Under Section 138 is a
company, every person who, at the time the offence was committed,
was in charge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct
of the business of the company, as well as the company, shall be
deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded
against and punished accordingly:
21. This Court in Aneeta Hada, had an occasion to examine the question ""whether an
authorised signatory of a company would be liable for prosecution Under Section 138 of
the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for brevity ""the Act"") without the company being
arraigned as an Accused"" and held as follows:
59. In view of our aforesaid analysis, we arrive at the irresistible conclusion
that for maintaining the prosecution Under Section 141 of the Act, arraigning of
a company as an Accused is imperative. The other categories of offenders can
only be brought in the drag-net on the touchstone of vicarious liability as the
same has been stipulated in the provision itself. ...
Yet the High Court reached a conclusion that the revision filed by the Petitioner is not
maintainable because DAKSHIN did not choose to challenge the trial court's order.
The High Court failed to appreciate that the liability of the Appellant (if any in the
context of the facts of the present case) is only statutory because of his legal status as
the DIRECTOR of DAKSHIN. Every person signing a cheque on behalf of a company on
whose account a cheque is drawn does not become the drawer of the cheque. Such a
signatory is only a person duly authorised to sign the cheque on behalf of the
company/drawer of the cheque. If DAKSHIN/drawer of the cheque is sought to be
summoned for being tried for an offence Under Section 138 of THE ACT beyond the
period of limitation prescribed under THE ACT, the Appellant cannot be told in view of
the law declared by this Court in Aneeta Hada that he can make no grievance of that
fact on the ground that DAKSHIN did not make any grievance of such summoning. It is
always open to DAKSHIN to raise the defense that the initiation of prosecution against it
is barred by limitation. DAKSHIN need not necessarily challenge the summoning order.
It can raise such a defense in the course of trial.
Coming to the view of the High Court that only the offence is taken cognizance of and
there is no need to take cognizance of an offence Accused-wise is an erroneous view in
the context of a prosecution under THE ACT. Most probably the High Court recorded
such conclusion (though not expressly stated) on the basis of the judgment of this
Court in Raghubans Dubey v. State of Bihar MANU/SC/0074/1967 : AIR 1967 SC
1167, where it was stated:
Para 9. ... In our opinion, once cognizance has been taken by the Magistrate, he
takes cognizance of an offence and not the offenders; once he takes cognizance
of an offence it is his duty to find out who the offenders really are and once he
comes to the conclusion that apart from the persons sent up by the police some
other persons are involved, it is his duty to proceed against those persons. ...
Such a statement of law was made by this Court in the background of the scheme of the
Code of Criminal Procedure.
22. The Code of Criminal Procedure is an enactment which is designed to regulate the
procedures governing the investigation of crimes in order to get the perpetrators of the
crime punished. A crime is an act or omission prohibited by law attracting certain legal
consequences like imprisonment, fine etc. Obviously, acts or omissions constituting
offences/crimes are capable of being committed only by persons either natural or
juridical.
The Code of Criminal Procedure imposes a duty on the investigating agencies to gather
evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a crime and to trace out the
perpetrators of the crime in order to get them punished. Punishment can be inflicted
only by a competent Court but not by the investigating agency. Courts are authorised to
inflict punishment if only they are satisfied that the evidence gathered by the
investigating agency is sufficient to establish that (1) a crime had been committed; and
(2) the persons charged with the offence (Accused) and brought before the Court by the
investigating agency for trial are the perpetrators of the crime.
Under the Scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure, any investigating agency
(normally the police) is bound to investigate by following the procedure prescribed
therein once it receives either information regarding the commission of a cognizable
offence or an order from a Magistrate to investigate into the allegation of the occurrence
of a non-cognizable offence and submit a report Under Section 173. Section 173(2)(i)
(d) inter alia stipulates that the report should contain a statement:
Whether any offence appears to have been committed and if so by whom?
The conclusions reached by the police after investigation into the above two questions
are required to be scrutinized by a competent Court. It is only after the Court is satisfied
that the evidence collected by the investigating agency is sufficient in law to punish the
Accused, such Accused can be punished. Taking cognizance of an offence by the Court
is one of the initial steps in the process. Thereafter, the investigating agency is required
to collect evidence (investigate) and place the same before the Court Under Section 173
Code of Criminal Procedure.
2 3 . The scheme of the prosecution in punishing Under Section 138 of THE ACT is
different from the scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 138 creates an
offence and prescribes punishment. No procedure for the investigation of the offence is
contemplated. The prosecution is initiated on the basis of a written complaint made by
the payee of a cheque. Obviously such complaints must contain the factual allegations
constituting each of the ingredients of the offence Under Section 138. Those ingredients
are: (1) that a person drew a cheque on an account maintained by him with the banker;
(2) that such a cheque when presented to the bank is returned by the bank unpaid; (3)
that such a cheque was presented to the bank within a period of six months from the
date it was drawn or within the period of its validity whichever is earlier; (4) that the
payee demanded in writing from the drawer of the cheque the payment of the amount of
money due under the cheque to payee; and (5) such a notice of payment is made within
a period of 30 days from the date of the receipt of the information by the payee from
the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid. It is obvious from the scheme of
Section 138 that each one of the ingredients flows from a document which evidences
the existence of such an ingredient. The only other ingredient which is required to be
proved to establish the commission of an offence Under Section 138 is that inspite of
the demand notice referred to above, the drawer of the cheque failed to make the
payment within a period of 15 days from the date of the receipt of the demand. A fact
which the complainant can only assert but not prove, the burden would essentially be
on the drawer of the cheque to prove that he had in fact made the payment pursuant to
the demand.
24. By the nature of the offence Under Section 138 of THE ACT, the first ingredient
constituting the offence is the fact that a person drew a cheque. The identity of the
drawer of the cheque is necessarily required to be known to the complainant (payee)
and needs investigation and would not normally be in dispute unless the person who is
alleged to have drawn a cheque disputes that very fact. The other facts required to be
proved for securing the punishment of the person who drew a cheque that eventually
got dishonoured is that the payee of the cheque did in fact comply with each one of the
steps contemplated Under Section 138 of THE ACT before initiating prosecution.
Because it is already held by this Court that failure to comply with any one of the steps
contemplated Under Section 138 would not provide ""cause of action for prosecution"".
Therefore, in the context of a prosecution Under Section 138, the concept of taking
cognizance of the offence but not the offender is not appropriate. Unless the complaint
contains all the necessary factual allegations constituting each of the ingredients of the
offence Under Section 138, the Court cannot take cognizance of the offence. Disclosure
of the name of the person drawing the cheque is one of the factual allegations which a
complaint is required to contain. Otherwise in the absence of any authority of law to
investigate the offence Under Section 138, there would be no person against whom a
Court can proceed. There cannot be a prosecution without an Accused. The offence
Under Section 138 is person specific. Therefore, the Parliament declared Under Section
142 that the provisions dealing with taking cognizance contained in the Code of
Criminal Procedure should give way to the procedure prescribed Under Section 142.
Hence the opening of non-obstante Clause Under Section 142. It must also be
remembered that Section 142 does not either contemplate a report to the police or
authorise the Court taking cognizance to direct the police to investigate into the
complaint.
2 5 . The question whether the Respondent had sufficient cause for not filing the
complaint against DAKSHIN within the period prescribed under THE ACT is not
examined by either of the courts below. As rightly pointed out, the application, which is
the subject matter of the instant appeal purportedly filed invoking Section 319 Code of
Criminal Procedure, is only a device by which the Respondent seeks to initiate
prosecution against DAKSHIN beyond the period of limitation stipulated under the Act.
26. No doubt Section 142 authorises the Court to condone the delay in appropriate
cases. We find no reason to condone the delay. The justification advanced by the
Respondent that it is during the course of the trial, the Respondent realized that the
cheque in question was drawn on the account of DAKSHIN is a manifestly false
statement. On the face of the cheque, it is clear that it was drawn on account of
DAKSHIN. Admittedly the Respondent issued a notice contemplated under Clause (b) of
the proviso to Section 138 to DAKSHIN. The fact is recorded by the High Court. The
relevant portion is already extracted in para 16.
27. The judgment under appeal is contrary to the language of THE ACT as expounded
by this Court in Aneeta Hada (supra) and, therefore, cannot be sustained. The
judgment is, accordingly, set aside. The appeal is allowed. In the circumstances, the
costs is quantified at Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Only).

Where any cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with a banker

complaint within one month of the date on which the cause of action arises

or any one of the learned counsel who appeared in the case or by the parties.
5However, this Court in MSR Leathers v. S. Palaniappan and Anr.,
MANU/SC/0797/2012 : (2013) 1 SCC 177 held; 10. Proviso to Section 138, however, is
all important and stipulates three distinct conditions precedent, which must be satisfied
before the dishonour of a cheque can constitute an offence and become punishable. The
first condition is that the cheque ought to have been presented to the bank within a
period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its
validity, whichever is earlier. The second condition is that the payee or the holder in due
course of the cheque, as the case may be, ought to make a demand for the payment of
the said amount of money by giving a notice in writing, to the drawer of the cheque,
within thirty days of the receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the
return of the cheque as unpaid. The third condition is that the drawer of such a cheque
should have failed to make payment of the said amount of money to the payee or as the
case may be, to the holder in due course of the cheque within fifteen days of the receipt
of the said notice. It is only upon the satisfaction of all the three conditions
mentioned above and enumerated under the proviso to Section 138 as clauses
(a), (b) and (c) thereof that an offence Under Section 138 can be said to have
been committed by the person issuing the cheque.","Appellants: N. Harihara Krishnan

CRIMINAL MATTERS - MATTERS CHALLENGING PROSECUTION UNDER NEGOTIABLE
INSTRUMENTS ACT
Facts:
Respondent filed complaint against Appellant under Section 138 of the Act for
dishonouring of cheque on the ground that the account on which the cheque
was drawn had been closed. The cheque in question was drawn on the
account of Appellant company and the Appellant was only a signatory as a
Director of Appellant company. The Trial Court allowed the application of
Respondent. The Trial Court concluded that since the case was already taken
on file and cognizance of the offence was taken separate petition to condone
the delay was not necessary and Appellant company was impleaded as an
accused. Appellant who was an individual person and who signed the cheque
represents the company. The High Court concluded that no revision was filed
by Appellant company and the revision preferred by the Appellant was not
maintainable. Hence present appeal by Appellant.
Held, while allowing the appeal:
(i) The logic of the High Court that since the offence was already taken
cognizance of, there was no need to take cognizance of the offence against
Appellant company was flawed. The High Court failed to appreciate that the
liability of the Appellant was only statutory because of his legal status as the
director of Appellant company. Every person signing a cheque on behalf of a
company on whose account a cheque was drawn did not become the drawer
of the cheque. Such a signatory was only a person duly authorised to sign the
cheque on behalf of the company of the cheque. If drawer of the cheque was
sought to be summoned for being tried for an offence under Section 138 of
Act beyond the period of limitation the Appellant could not be told that he
could make no grievance of that fact on the ground that Appellant company
did not make any grievance of such summoning. It was always open to
Appellant company to raise the defense that the initiation of prosecution
against it was barred by limitation. The view of the High Court that only the
offence was taken cognizance of and there was no need to take cognizance of
an offence Appellant-wise was an erroneous view in the context of a
prosecution under the Act. [21]
(ii) The scheme of the prosecution in punishing under Section 138 of the Act
was different from the scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 138
creates an offence and prescribes punishment. No procedure for the
investigation of the offence was contemplated. The prosecution was initiated
on the basis of a written complaint made by the payee of a cheque. The
identity of the drawer of the cheque was necessarily required to be known to
the payee and needed investigation and would not normally be in dispute
unless the person who was alleged to have drawn a cheque disputes that very
fact. The other facts required to be proved for securing the punishment of the
person who drew a cheque that eventually got dishonoured was that the
payee of the cheque did in fact comply with each one of the steps
contemplated under Section 138 of the Act before initiating prosecution. [23]
and[24]
(iii) The justification advanced by the Respondent that it was during the
course of the trial, the Respondent realized that the cheque in question was
drawn on the account of Appellant company was a manifestly false statement.
On the face of the cheque, it was clear that it was drawn on account of
Appellant company. Order of High Court was set aside. [26]",,,,
"Navin Sinha, J.
1. The Appellant is aggrieved by order dated 4.10.2005 allowing the writ petition of the
Respondent, setting aside the auction notice Under Section 85 of the Himachal Pradesh
Public Moneys (Recovery of Dues) Act, 1973 (hereinafter be referred to as ""the Act"")
issued consequent to his failure to repay the two loans availed for purchase of a truck
and establishing an industry for manufacture of steel trunks.
2. The Respondent has remained unrepresented despite valid service of notice.
3 . Learned Senior Counsel Shri J.S. Attri, on behalf of the Appellant, submits that the
High Court has erred by inferring abandonment of the claim by withdrawal of the Suit.
The withdrawal was made to initiate fresh proceedings under the Act, as it provided for
a more speedy and effective remedy, under a special law. The absence of any liberty in
the withdrawal order is not relevant. There was no bar under the Act to the proceedings.
The remedy Under Section 3(1)(d)(iv) of the Act was independent and without prejudice
to any other mode of recovery under any law for the time being in force, and which will
include a Suit. The High Court had wrongly applied the principle of 'public policy' to
restrain recovery of a public loan. The doctrine of election had no application in the
facts of the case.
4 . The High Court erred on facts in holding that the proceedings under the Act for
recovery of the trunk loan was initiated only in the year 2003, and that nothing had
been done by the Appellant from 1996 till 2002 thus making the claim time barred. The
recovery certificate had been issued by the Collector as far as back 3.9.1994. It was
stalled by the Respondent filing writ petitions before the High Court. The High Court had
granted liberty to the Appellant for proceeding afresh in accordance with law.
5. We have considered the submissions, as also perused the materials on record.
6 . The Respondent applied for a loan of Rs. 1.90 lakhs in 1989 to purchase a Swaraz
Mazda truck and executed a hypothecation deed. Repayment Schedule commenced from
10.1.1990 culminating on 10.7.1994. Rs. 10,000/- only was repaid on 6.3.1991. The
vehicle was seized on 6.5.1991 Under Section 29 of the State Finance Corporation Act,
1951 and auction sold on 4.9.1991 for a sum of Rs. 1.46 lakhs. A Money Suit was filed
before the Senior Sub Judge, Shimla for recovery of the balance of Rs. 1,25,270/- along
with future interest and costs. The Suit was withdrawn on 12.12.1995 under Order 23,
Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure stating that the Appellant desired to proceed under
the Act. The Suit was dismissed as withdrawn. Recovery Certificate was then issued
under the Act on 19.4.1996 for a sum of Rs. 1,94,283/- followed by a warrant of arrest.
7 . The Respondent thwarted the Certificate proceedings by filing a Suit before the
Senior Sub Judge, Shimla contending that the fresh proceedings were barred due to
withdrawal of the Suit without any liberty, and that the claim was time barred. An
interim-order was obtained, but ultimately the Suit was dismissed for non-prosecution
on 21.5.2001.
8 . Another loan of Rs. 30,000/- was availed by the Respondent on 15.12.1988 for a
trunk industry and a hypothecation-deed executed in respect of property bearing
Khata/Khatuni No. 102/347, Khasra No. 1014. The last installment of the loan was
payable on 10.1.1996. The Respondent remitted Rs. 4,000/- in May 1991 and Rs.
1,000/- in November 1991. A request was made before the Collector for recovery
certificate on 12.11.1992, and the Certificate was issued on 3.9.1994. The Respondent
objected that no prior notice was given and that the proceedings were time barred.
9 . The Respondent instituted C.W.P. No. 1102 of 2002 before the High Court
questioning both the recovery proceedings. The writ petition was allowed on technical
grounds with liberty to the Appellant for proceeding afresh in accordance with law.
Fresh show cause notices were then issued in respect of the two loans on 26.11.2002
and 2.11.2002 respectively, followed by fresh recovery certificates on 10.3.2003 for
recovery of Rs. 5,50,165/- and Rs. 61,503.92/- respectively.
1 0 . The Respondent again filed C.W.P. No. 136 of 2005 pursuant to which the
impugned order came to be passed.
1 1 . The High Court relying on Sarguja Transport Service v. State Transport
Appellate Tribunal MANU/SC/0114/1986 : AIR 1987 SC 88, held that the Suit having
been withdrawn unconditionally for inexplicable reasons, and without any liberty
granted under Order 23 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure for initiating appropriate
legal proceedings, it amounted to abandonment of the claim for the truck loan. It would
be contrary to public policy and abuse of the process of law to allow any fresh
proceeding for the same cause of action. The doctrine of election was also invoked. The
loan with regard to the trunk industry was held to be time barred as no action was
taken for recovery from 1996 till 2002.
1 2 . The factum of loan is not in dispute. No explanation was furnished why the
installments were not repaid and the loan closed. A pittance was repaid. The loan was
disbursed from public funds of the tax payers' money. The Respondent was a trustee for
the loan amount. It could not become a windfall for him. All attempts by the Appellant
for recovery were successfully thwarted by the Respondent by either filing a Suit or
successive writ petitions. The sanguine confidence of the Respondent is also reflected
by his failure to appear in the present proceedings despite valid service of notice.
13. The question whether there has been an abandonment of the claim by withdrawal of
the Suit is a mixed question of law and fact as held in Ramesh Chandra Sankla v.
Vikram Cement MANU/SC/7810/2008 : (2008) 14 SCC 58. The language of the order
for withdrawal will not always be determinative. The background facts will necessarily
have to be examined for a proper and just decision. Sarguja Transport Service
(supra) cannot be applied as an abstract proposition or the ratio applied sans the facts
of a case. The extract below is considered relevant observing as follows:
9...... While the withdrawal of a writ petition filed in a High Court without
permission to file a fresh writ petition may not bar other remedies like a
suit........
14. The application for withdrawal stated that it was being done to pursue remedies
under the Act. Undoubtedly the proceedings under the Act are more expeditious for
recovery as compared to a Suit, which after decree is required to be followed by
Execution proceedings. Section 3(1)(d)(iv) of the Act provided that the remedy under it
was without prejudice to any other remedy available under any other law. The
Appellant, therefore, never intended to abandon its claim by withdrawing the Suit. The
language of the withdrawal order cannot be determinative without considering the
background facts.
1 5 . The bar under Order 23 Rule 1 would apply only to a fresh Suit and not
proceedings under the Act. In Sarva Shramik Sanghatana v. State of Maharashtra
MANU/SC/8144/2007 : (2008) 1 SCC 494, the application Under Section 25-O of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 for closure of undertaking was withdrawn as attempts
were made for settlement of the matter. Settlement not having been possible, the
Management filed a fresh application. It was opposed as barred under Order 23 of the
Code of Civil Procedure since the earlier application was withdrawn unconditionally with
no liberty granted, relying on Sarguja Transport Service (supra). The argument was
repelled holding that the proceedings under the Industrial Disputes Act were not a Suit
and that withdrawal was bonafide to explore amicable settlement. It was not a
withdrawal made malafide or for Bench hunting holding as follows:
22. No doubt, Order 23 Rule 1(4) Code of Civil Procedure states that where the
Plaintiff withdraws a suit without permission of the court, he is precluded from
instituting any fresh suit in respect of the same subject-matter. However, in our
opinion, this provision will apply only to suits. An application Under Section
25-O(1) is not a suit, and hence, the said provision will not apply to such an
application.
16. In Vikram Cement (supra) the earlier petition was dismissed as not pressed and
the second application was opposed as not maintainable. Dismissing the objection it
was observed as follows:
65. It is thus clear that it was not a case of abandonment or giving up of claim
by the Company. But, in view of the office objection, practical difficulty and
logistical problems, the Petitioner Company did not proceed with an ""omnibus""
and composite petition against several workmen and filed separate petitions as
suggested by the Registry of the High Court.
17. The Act provides for recovery of certain dues as arrears of land revenue by sending
a certificate to the Collector, mentioning the sum due requesting that the sum together
with costs may be recovered. The High Court erred in holding that the H.P. Public
Moneys (Recovery of Dues) Act, 2000 repealing the earlier Act did not contain any
provision that the remedy was without prejudice to the rights under any other law. The
proceedings in a Suit and recovery under the Act as arrears of land revenue are under
different laws governed by different procedures. A Suit is instituted in a Court of law
and is governed by the Code of Civil Procedure while the proceedings under the Act are
before the executive statutorily empowered. In C.C.E. v. Ramdev Tobacco Co.
MANU/SC/0531/1991 : (1991)(2) SCC 119, the distinction was noticed as follows:
6....... There can be no doubt that 'suit' or 'prosecution' are those judicial or
legal proceedings which are lodged in a court of law and not before any
executive authority, even if a statutory one......
18. That the proceedings in a Suit could not be equated with a certificate proceeding
was further noticed in ESI Corporation v. C.C. Santhakumar MANU/SC/8689/2006 :
(2007) 1 SCC 584, observing:
25....... Therefore, it cannot be said that a proceeding for recovery as arrears
of land revenue by issuing a certificate could be equated to either a suit, appeal
or application in the court......
19. The phrase 'public policy' is not capable of precise definition. In P. Rathinam v.
Union of India MANU/SC/0433/1994 : (1994) 3 SCC 394, it was observed:
92. The concept of public policy is, however, illusive, varying and uncertain. It
has also been described as ""untrustworthy guide"", ""unruly horse"" etc....
Broadly it will mean what is in the larger interest of the society involving questions of
righteousness, good conscience and equity upholding the law and not a retrograde
interpretation. It cannot be invoked to facilitate a loanee to avoid legal obligation for
repayment of a loan. The loanee has a pious duty to abide by his promise and repay.
Timely repayment ensures facilitation of the loan to others who may be needy. Public
policy cannot be invoked to effectively prevent a loanee from repayment unjustifiably
abusing the law. Invocation of the principle of doctrine of election in the facts of the
case was completely misconceived.
2 0 . The High Court factually erred in holding that the trunk loan was time barred
because the Appellant took no steps for recovery of the dues from 1996 till 2002
overlooking the Certificate dated 3.9.1994.
21. In conclusion, it is held that the proceedings in a Suit are essentially different from
proceedings under the Act. The withdrawal of the Suit was no bar to proceedings under
the Act. There was no bar under the Act to the proceedings. There had been no
abandonment of claim by the Appellant. It would be contrary to public policy to prevent
the Appellant from recovering the loan. The recovery proceedings were not time barred.
The order of the High Court is held to be unsustainable and is set aside. The auction
notice dated 13.01.2005/15.01.2005 Under Section 85 of the Act shall now proceed in
accordance with law and be concluded at the earliest expeditiously.
22. The appeal is allowed.

MERCANTILE LAWS, COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING BANKING - MATTERS
RELATING TO RECOVERY OF DEBTS/ BANK LOANS DUE UNDER THE BANKS AND
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
Facts:
The Respondent applied for a loan to purchase a truck and executed a
hypothecation deed. Only a nominal amount was repaid. The vehicle was
seized and auction sold for a partial sum. A Money Suit was filed before for
recovery of the balance along with future interest and costs. The Suit was
withdrawn stating that the Appellant desired to proceed under the Act. The
Suit was dismissed as withdrawn. Recovery Certificate was then issued under
the Act followed by a warrant of arrest. The Respondent thwarted the
Certificate proceedings by filing a Suit contending that the fresh proceedings
were barred due to withdrawal of the Suit without any liberty, and that the
claim was time barred. An interim-order was obtained, but ultimately the Suit
was dismissed for non-prosecution. Another loan was availed by the
Respondent for a industry and a hypothecation-deed executed in respect of
property. The last installment of the loan was payable on 10.1.1996. The
Respondent remitted Rs. 4,000/- in May 1991 and Rs. 1,000/- in November
1991. A request was made before the Collector for recovery certificate on
12.11.1992, and the Certificate was issued on 3.9.1994. The Respondent
objected that no prior notice was given and that the proceedings were time
barred. The Respondent instituted petition before the High Court questioning
both the recovery proceedings. The petition was allowed on technical grounds
with liberty to the Appellant for proceeding afresh in accordance with law.
Fresh show cause notices were then issued, followed by fresh recovery
certificates for recovery. The Respondent again filed petition pursuant to
which the impugned order came to be passed setting aside the auction notice.
The High Court relying on Sarguja Transport Service v. State Transport
Appellate Tribunal, held that the Suit having been withdrawn unconditionally
for inexplicable reasons, and without any liberty granted under Order 23 Rule
1 of the Code of Civil Procedure for initiating appropriate legal proceedings, it
amounted to abandonment of the claim for the truck loan. It would be
contrary to public policy and abuse of the process of law to allow any fresh
proceeding for the same cause of action. The doctrine of election was also
invoked. The loan with regard to the trunk industry was held to be time
barred as no action was taken for recovery from 1996 till 2002. Hence, the
present appeal.
Held, while allowing the appeal:
(i) The proceedings under the Act are more expeditious for recovery as
compared to a Suit, which after decree is required to be followed by Execution
proceedings. Section 3(1)(d)(iv) of the Act provided that the remedy under it
was without prejudice to any other remedy available under any other law.
The Appellant, therefore, never intended to abandon its claim by withdrawing
the Suit. The language of the withdrawal order cannot be determinative
without considering the background facts. The bar under Order 23 Rule 1
would apply only to a fresh Suit and not proceedings under the Act. [14]
and[15]
(ii) A Suit is instituted in a Court of law and is governed by the Code of Civil
Procedure while the proceedings under the Act are before the executive
statutorily empowered. The phrase 'public policy' will mean what is in the
larger interest of the society involving questions of righteousness, good
conscience and equity upholding the law and not a retrograde interpretation.
It cannot be invoked to facilitate a loanee to avoid legal obligation for
repayment of a loan. The loanee has a pious duty to abide by his promise and
repay. Timely repayment ensures facilitation of the loan to others who may be
needy. Public policy cannot be invoked to effectively prevent a loanee from
repayment unjustifiably abusing the law. Invocation of the principle of
doctrine of election was completely misconceived. [17] and[19]
(iii) The High Court erred in holding that the trunk loan was time barred
because the Appellant took no steps for recovery of the dues from 1996 till
2002 overlooking the Certificate dated 3.9.1994. The proceedings in a Suit
are essentially different from proceedings under the Act. The withdrawal of
the Suit was no bar to proceedings under the Act. There was no bar under the
Act to the proceedings. There had been no abandonment of claim by the
Appellant. [20] and[21]

1. Leave granted.
2. Despite service, no one has entered appearance on behalf of the Respondent.
3 . A cheque No. 1950, drawn on the Union Bank of India, Chandigarh, was issued by
Inderpal Singh (the Respondent herein) to the Appellant - M/s. Bridgestone India Pvt.
Ltd. The cheque was in the sum of Rs. 26,958/-. The Appellant - M/s. Bridgestone India
Pvt. Ltd. presented the above cheque at the IDBI Bank in Indore. The Appellant received
intimation of its being dishonoured on account of ""...exceeds arrangement..."" on
04.08.2006 at Indore.
4 . The Appellant issued a legal notice on 26.08.2006, which was served on the
Respondent-Inderpal Singh on 06.09.2006, demanding the amount depicted in the
cheque. The Appellant informed the Respondent, that he would be compelled to initiate
proceedings Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, if payment was
not made by the Respondent within 15 days from the date of receipt of the legal notice.
5 . Consequent upon the issuance of the aforementioned legal notice wherein the
Respondent was required to reimburse the cheque amount to the Appellant, and the
Respondent having failed to discharge his obligation, proceedings were initiated by the
Appellant on 13.10.2006 in the Court of the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Indore,
Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.
6. The accused-Respondent-Inderpal Singh, preferred an application before the Judicial
Magistrate, First Class, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, Under Section 177 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, contesting the territorial jurisdiction with respect to the above
cheque drawn on the Union Bank of India, Chandigarh. The prayer made by the
Respondent, that the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Indore, did not have the
jurisdiction to entertain the proceedings initiated by the Appellant - M/s. Bridgestone
Indian Pvt. Ltd. was declined on 02.06.2009. The Judicial Magistrate, First Class,
Indore, relied on the judgment rendered by this Court in K. Bhaskaran v. Sankaran
Vaidhyan Balan and Anr. MANU/SC/0625/1999 : AIR 1999 SC 3762, to record a finding
in favour of the Appellant. Dissatisfied with the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate,
First Class, Indore, dated 02.06.2009, the Respondent-Inderpal Singh preferred a
petition Under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in the High Court of
Madhya Pradesh before its Indore Bench. Having examined the controversy in hand and
keeping in mind the fact, that a number of documents were presented by the
Respondent-Inderpal Singh during the course of hearing before the High Court, by an
order dated 03.12.2009, the petition filed by the accused-Respondent was disposed of,
by remitting the case to the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Indore, requiring him to
pass a fresh order after taking into consideration the additional documents relied upon,
and the judgments cited before the High Court.
7. The Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Indore, yet again, by an order dated 11.01.2010
held, that he had the territorial jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the controversy raised by
the Appellant - M/s. Bridgestone India Pvt. Ltd. Under Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act, 1881. The decision rendered by the Judicial Magistrate, First Class,
Indore, was again assailed by the accused-Respondent in yet another petition filed by
him Under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in the High Court of Madhya
Pradesh before its Indore Bench. The High Court accepted the prayer made by the
accused-Respondent-Inderpal Singh by holding, that the jurisdiction lay only before the
Court wherein the original drawee bank was located, namely, at Chandigarh, wherefrom
the accused-Respondent had issued the concerned cheque bearing No. 1950,
drawn on the Union Bank of India, Chandigarh.
8 . Dissatisfied with the order passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, dated
05.05.2011, the Appellant has approached this Court through the instant appeal.
9 . During the course of hearing, learned Counsel for the Appellant cited the decision
rendered by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod v. State of
Maharashtra and Anr. MANU/SC/0655/2014 : (2014) 9 SCC 129, and pointedly invited
our attention to the conclusions drawn by this Court in paragraph 58, which is extracted
hereunder:
58. To sum up:
58.1 An offence Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,
1881 is committed no sooner a cheque drawn by the accused on an
account being maintained by him in a bank for discharge of
debt/liability is returned unpaid for insufficiency of funds or for the
reason that the amount exceeds the arrangement made with the bank.
5 8 . 2 Cognizance of any such offence is however forbidden Under
Section 142 of the Act except upon a complaint in writing made by the
payee or holder of the cheque in due course within a period of one
month from the date the cause of action accrues to such payee or
holder under Clause (c) of proviso to Section 138.
5 8 . 3 The cause of action to file a complaint accrues to a
complainant/payee/holder of a cheque in due course if
(a) the dishonoured cheque is presented to the drawee bank
within a period of six months from the date of its issue.
(b) If the complainant has demanded payment of cheque
amount within thirty days of receipt of information by him from
the bank regarding the dishonour of the cheque, and
(c) If the drawer has failed to pay the cheque amount within
fifteen days of receipt of such notice.
5 8 . 4 The facts constituting cause of action do not constitute the
ingredients of the offence Under Section 138 of the Act.
58.5 The proviso to Section 138 simply postpones/defers institution of
criminal proceedings and taking of cognizance by the court till such
time cause of action in terms of Clause (c) of proviso accrues to the
complainant.
5 8 . 6 Once the cause of action accrues to the complainant, the
jurisdiction of the Court to try the case will be determined by reference
to the place where the cheque is dishonoured.
58.7 The general rule stipulated Under Section 177 Code of Criminal
Procedure applies to cases Under Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act. Prosecution in such cases can, therefore, be launched
against the drawer of the cheque only before the court within whose
jurisdiction the dishonour takes place except in situations where the
offence of dishonour of the cheque punishable Under Section 138 is
committed along with other offences in a single transaction within the
meaning of Section 220(1) read with Section 184 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure or is covered by the provisions of Section 182(1)
read with Sections 184 and 220 thereof.
In view of the decision rendered by this Court in Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod's case, it is
apparent, that the impugned order dated 05.05.2011, passed by the High Court of
Madhya Pradesh, Bench at Indore, was wholly justified.
10. In order to overcome the legal position declared by this Court in Dashrath Rupsingh
Rathod's case, learned Counsel for the Appellant has drawn our attention to the
Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015 (hereinafter referred to
as 'the Ordinance'). A perusal of Section 1(2) thereof reveals, that the Ordinance would
be deemed to have come into force with effect from 15.06.2015. It is therefore pointed
out to us, that the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015 is in
force. Our attention was then invited to Section 3 thereof, whereby, the original Section
142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, came to be amended, and also, Section 4
thereof, whereby, Section 142A was inserted into the Negotiable Instruments Act.
Sections 3 and 4 of the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015
are being extracted hereunder:
3 . In the principal Act, Section 142 shall be numbered as Sub-section (1)
thereof and after Sub-section (1) as so numbered, the following Sub-section
shall be inserted, namely:
(2) The offence Under Section 138 shall be inquired into and tried only
by a court within whose local jurisdiction,-
(a) if the cheque is delivered for collection through an account,
the branch of the bank where the payee or holder in due
course, as the base may be, maintains the account, is situated;
or
(b) if the cheque is presented for payment by the payee or
holder in due course otherwise through an account, the branch
of the drawee bank where the drawer maintains the account, is
situated.
Explanation - For the purposes of Clause (a), where a cheque is
delivered for collection at any branch of the bank of the payee
or holder in due course, then, the cheque shall be deemed to
have been delivered to the branch of the bank in which the
payee or holder in due course, as the case may be, maintains
the account.
4 . In the principal Act, after Section 142, the following section shall be
inserted, namely:
142A. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 or any judgment, decree, order or directions of any
court, all cases transferred to the court having jurisdiction Under Subsection
(2) of Section 142, as amended by the Negotiable Instruments
(Amendment) Ordinance, 2015, shall be deemed to have been
transferred under this Ordinance, as if that Sub-section had been in
force at all material times.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (2) of Section
142 or Sub-section (1), where the payee or the holder in due course,
as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a
cheque in the court having jurisdiction Under Sub-section (2) of
Section 142 or the case has been transferred to that court Under Subsection
(1), and such complaint is pending in that court, all subsequent
complaints arising out of Section 138 against the same drawer shall be
filed before the same court irrespective of whether those cheques were
delivered for collection or presented for payment within the territorial
jurisdiction of that court.
(3) If, on the date of the commencement of this Ordinance, more than
one prosecution filed by the same payee or holder in due course, as the
case may be, against the same drawer of cheques is pending before
different courts, upon the said fact having been brought to the notice of
the court, such court shall transfer the case to the court having
jurisdiction Under Sub-section (2) of Section 142, as amended by the
Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Ordinance, 2015, before which
the first case was filed and is pending, as if that Sub-section had been
in force at all material times.
(Emphasis is ours)
A perusal of the amended Section 142(2), extracted above, leaves no room for any
doubt, specially in view of the explanation thereunder, that with reference to an offence
Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the place where a cheque is
delivered for collection i.e. the branch of the bank of the payee or holder in due course,
where the drawee maintains an account, would be determinative of the place of
territorial jurisdiction.
11. It is, however, imperative for the present controversy, that the Appellant overcomes
the legal position declared by this Court, as well as, the provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, a reference
may be made to Section 4 of the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Second
Ordinance, 2015, whereby Section 142A was inserted into the Negotiable Instruments
Act. A perusal of Sub-section (1) thereof leaves no room for any doubt, that insofar as
the offence Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is concerned, on the
issue of jurisdiction, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, would
have to give way to the provisions of the instant enactment on account of the nonobstante
clause in Sub-section (1) of Section 142A. Likewise, any judgment, decree,
order or direction issued by a Court would have no effect insofar as the territorial
jurisdiction for initiating proceedings Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments
Act is concerned. In the above view of the matter, we are satisfied, that the judgment
rendered by this Court in Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod's case would also not non-suit the
Appellant for the relief claimed.
12. We are in complete agreement with the contention advanced at the hands of the
learned Counsel for the Appellant. We are satisfied, that Section 142(2)(a), amended
through the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015, vests
jurisdiction for initiating proceedings for the offence Under Section 138 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act, inter alia in the territorial jurisdiction of the Court, where
the cheque is delivered for collection (through an account of the branch of the bank
where the payee or holder in due course maintains an account). We are also satisfied,
based on Section 142A(1) to the effect, that the judgment rendered by this Court in
Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod' s case, would not stand in the way of the Appellant, insofar
as the territorial jurisdiction for initiating proceedings emerging from the dishonor of
the cheque in the present case arises.
13. Since cheque No. 1950, in the sum of Rs. 26,958/-, drawn on the Union Bank of
India, Chandigarh, dated 02.05.2006, was presented for encashment at the IDBI Bank,
Indore, which intimated its dishonor to the Appellant on 04.08.2006, we are of the view
that the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Indore, would have the territorial jurisdiction to
take cognizance of the proceedings initiated by the Appellant Under Section 138 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, after the promulgation of the Negotiable Instruments
(Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015. The words ""...as if that Sub-section had been in
force at all material times..."" used with reference to Section 142(2), in Section 142A(1)
gives retrospectivity to the provision.
14. In the above view of the matter, the instant appeal is allowed, and the impugned
order passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, by its Indore Bench, dated
05.05.2011, is set aside. The parties are directed to appear before the Judicial
Magistrate, First Class, Indore, on 15.01.2016. In case the complaint filed by the
Appellant has been returned, it shall be re-presented before the Judicial Magistrate, First
Class, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, on the date of appearance indicated hereinabove.

Appeal No. 1564 of 2015 (Arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 10020 of 2011)
15. Leave granted.
16. Despite service, no one has entered appearance on behalf of the Respondent.
17. Learned Counsel for the Appellant states, that the controversy raised in the instant
appeals is identical to the one adjudicated upon by this Court in Criminal Appeal No.

offence Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, vests in the

Facts:
A cheque drawn on the Union Bank of India, Chandigarh, was issued by
Inderpal Singh (the Respondent herein) to the Appellant - M/s. Bridgestone
India Pvt. Ltd. The Appellant presented the above cheque at the IDBI Bank in
Indore. The Appellant received intimation of its being dishonoured on account
of ""...exceeds arrangement..."" on 04.08.2006 at Indore.
The Appellant issued a legal notice on 26.08.2006, which was served on the
Respondent-Inderpal Singh on 06.09.2006, demanding the amount depicted
in the cheque. The Appellant informed the Respondent, that he would be
compelled to initiate proceedings Under Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act, 1881, if payment was not made by the Respondent within
15 days from the date of receipt of the legal notice.
Consequent upon the issuance of the aforementioned legal notice,
proceedings were initiated by the Appellant on 13.10.2006 in the Court of the
Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Indore, Under Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act, 1881. The accused-Respondent preferred an application
before the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Indore, Under Section 177 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, contesting the territorial jurisdiction with respect
to the above cheque drawn on the Union Bank of India, Chandigarh. The
prayer made by the Respondent that Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Indore
did not have jurisdiction to entertain the proceedings initiated by the
Appellant was declined and the Magistrate recorded a finding in favour of the
Appellant.
Dissatisfied, the Respondent preferred a petition under Section 482 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, in the High Court. The petition filed by the
accused-Respondent was disposed of, by remitting the case to the Judicial
Magistrate, First Class, Indore, requiring him to pass a fresh order after taking
into consideration the additional documents relied upon, and the judgments
cited before the High Court. The Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Indore, yet
again held that he had the territorial jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the
controversy raised by the Appellant. The aforesaid decision was again assailed
by the accused-Respondent in yet another petition Under Section 482 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, in the High Court.
The High Court accepted the prayer made by the accused-Respondent by
holding that the jurisdiction lay only before the Court wherein the original
drawee bank was located, namely, at Chandigarh, where-from the accused-
Respondent had issued the concerned cheque, drawn on the Union Bank of
India, Chandigarh. Dissatisfied with the order passed by the High Court, the
Appellant has approached this Court through instant appeal.
Held, while allowing the appeal
1. During the course of hearing, learned Counsel for the Appellant cited the
decision rendered by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Dashrath Rupsingh
Rathod v. State of Maharashtra and Anr., in view of which, it is apparent that
the impugned order passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Bench at
Indore, was wholly justified.[9]
2. In order to overcome the legal position declared by this Court in Dashrath
Rupsingh Rathod v. State of Maharashtra and Anr., learned Counsel for the
Appellant has drawn the Court's attention to the Negotiable Instruments
(Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015 (the Ordinance). A perusal of Section
1(2) thereof reveals, that the Ordinance would be deemed to have come into
force with effect from 15.06.2015. It is therefore pointed out to the Court,
that the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015 is in
force. The Court's attention was then invited to Section 3 thereof, whereby,
the original Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, came to be
amended, and also, Section 4 thereof, whereby, Section 142A was inserted
into the Negotiable Instruments Act.[10]
3. A perusal of the amended Section 142(2), leaves no room for any doubt,
specially in view of the explanation thereunder, that with reference to an
offence Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the place
where a cheque is delivered for collection i.e. the branch of the bank of the
payee or holder in due course, where the drawee maintains an account, would
be determinative of the place of territorial jurisdiction.[10]
4. It is, however, imperative for the present controversy, that the Appellant
overcomes the legal position declared by this Court, as well as, the provisions
of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter
is concerned, a reference may be made to Section 4 of the Negotiable
Instruments (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015, whereby Section 142A
was inserted into the Negotiable Instruments Act. A perusal of Sub-section
(1) thereof leaves no room for any doubt, that insofar as the offence Under
Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is concerned, on the issue of
jurisdiction, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, would
have to give way to the provisions of the instant enactment on account of the
non-obstante clause in Sub-section (1) of Section 142A. Likewise, any
judgment, decree, order or direction issued by a Court would have no effect
insofar as the territorial jurisdiction for initiating proceedings Under Section
138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is concerned. In the above view of the
matter, the Court is satisfied, that the judgment rendered by this Court in
Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod v. State of Maharashtra and Anr.would also not
non-suit the Appellant for the relief claimed.[11]
5. The Court is in complete agreement with the contention advanced at the
hands of the learned Counsel for the Appellant. The Court is satisfied, that
Section 142(2)(a), amended through the Negotiable Instruments
(Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015, vests jurisdiction for initiating
proceedings for the offence Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments
Act, inter alia in the territorial jurisdiction of the Court, where the cheque is
delivered for collection (through an account of the branch of the bank where
the payee or holder in due course maintains an account). The Court is also
satisfied, based on Section 142A(1) to the effect, that the judgment rendered
by this Court in Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod v. State of Maharashtra and Anr.,
would not stand in the way of the Appellant, insofar as the territorial
jurisdiction for initiating proceedings emerging from the dishonor of the
cheque in the present case arises.[12]
6. Since cheque drawn on the Union Bank of India, Chandigarh, was
presented for encashment at the IDBI Bank, Indore, which intimated its
dishonor to the Appellant on 04.08.2006, the Court is of the view that the
Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Indore, would have the territorial jurisdiction
to take cognizance of the proceedings initiated by the Appellant Under
Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, after the promulgation
of the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Second Ordinance, 2015. The
words ""...as if that Sub-section had been in force at all material times..."" used
with reference to Section 142(2), in Section 142A(1) gives retrospectivity to
the provision.[13]
7. In the above view of the matter, the instant appeal is allowed, and the
impugned order passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, by its Indore
Bench, dated 05.05.2011, is set aside. The parties are directed to appear
before the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Indore, on 15.01.2016. In case the
complaint filed by the Appellant has been returned, it shall be re-presented
before the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, on the
date of appearance indicated hereinabove.[9]",,,,
"1. Leave granted. The sole Respondent herein, who, at the relevant point of time, was a
Director of one M/s. Movers Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as ""the Company""),
had executed two personal guarantees against a financial accommodation made
available by the Appellant bank to the Company in question. This was on 7th June, 1983
and 8th August, 1983 respectively. On 6th July, 1984 the Respondent resigned from the
Board of Directors of the Company and informed the Appellant - Bank with a request to
discharge the present Respondent from the guarantees executed by him. The Bank
intimated the present Respondent that the matter was being examined at the
appropriate decision making level. Sometime in 1985, one Mr. V. Nandakumar came in
as a Director of the Company in place of the present Respondent and he also executed
two personal guarantees which were accepted by the Bank. As there was default in
payment of the loan amount the Bank instituted a suit for recovery in the year 1992
which got transferred to the learned Debts Recovery Tribunal at Bangalore (hereinafter
referred to as ""Tribunal"") upon enforcement of the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and
Financial Institutions Act, 1993. The learned Tribunal by order dated 21st November,
2003 decreed the application of the Bank but restricted the liability of the present
Respondent to the amount of the two guarantees in question.
2. Aggrieved the present Respondent filed an appeal before the learned Debts Recovery
Appellate Tribunal, Bangalore (hereinafter referred to as ""Appellate Tribunal"") which
was allowed. One of the grounds that prevailed upon the learned Appellate Tribunal to
allow the appeal of the present Respondent was that the action of the Bank in accepting
the personal guarantees of Mr. V. Nandakumar (the new Director) amounted to
exoneration of the present Respondent from the guarantees executed by him. The
aforesaid order of the learned Appellate Tribunal is dated 21st July, 2005 and was
challenged by the Bank before the High Court by filing Writ Petition No. 9590 of 2006
out of which the present appeal has arisen. The said writ petition was dismissed by the
High Court by the impugned judgment and order dated 3rd January, 2013 again,
primarily, on the above said ground, namely, the induction of Mr. V. Nandakumar as a
new Director and the personal guarantees executed by him exonerated the Respondent
herein. Aggrieved the present appeal has been filed.
3. We have heard the learned Counsels for the parties.
4 . In the suit filed by the Bank which was transferred to the learned Tribunal the
present Respondent was impleaded as Defendant No. 6 and Mr. V. Nandakumar (the
new Director) who came in place of the present Respondent was impleaded as the
Defendant No. 7. The decree passed by the learned Tribunal made both the Defendant
Nos. 6 and 7 jointly liable, however, for the amounts of the guarantees executed by
them. It transpires that against the order of the learned Tribunal while the present
Respondent herein had filed an appeal i.e. R.A.No. 7/2005, the Defendant No. 7 in the
suit (Mr. V. Nandakumar, the new Director) filed a separate appeal i.e. R.A.-8/2005.
While R.A. No. 7 filed by the Respondent herein was decided by the learned Appellate
Tribunal on 21st July, 2005, the appeal filed by the Defendant No. 7 (Mr. V.
Nandakumar) was decided on 31st August, 2005. Against both the separate orders
passed by the learned Appellate Tribunal, the Bank had filed two separate writ petitions
i.e. Writ Petition No. 9590 of 2006 against the order of the learned Appellate Tribunal
dated 21st July, 2005 and Writ Petition No. 24303 of 2005 against the order of the
learned Appellate Tribunal dated 31st August, 2005. By the impugned judgment and
order dated 3rd January, 2003, while the Writ Petition No. 9590 of 2006 filed by the
Bank against the present Respondent was decided, we are told that the Writ Petition No.
24303 of 2005 filed by the Bank against Mr. V. Nandakumar (the new Director) is still
pending consideration before the High Court and is awaiting the outcome of the present
appeal.
5. The cardinal issue in the writ petition (Writ Petition No. 9590 of 2006) out of which
the present appeal has arisen being what has been noticed, namely, that the induction
of Mr. V. Nandakumar (the new Director) and the execution of the personal guarantees
by him exonerated or discharged the present Respondent from the bank guarantees
which were furnished by him made it imperative that both the writ petitions i.e. Writ
Petition No. 9590 of 2006 and Writ Petition No. 24303 of 2005 should have been heard
together. Whether the guarantees executed by the two Directors i.e. Defendant Nos. 6
and 7, both, continue to remain in force or the acceptance of the one would work as
exoneration of the other could not have been decided in the writ petition filed by the
Bank against the Respondent herein without taking into consideration the writ petition
filed by the Bank against Mr. V. Nandakumar (the new Director). We do not know and
the said issue need not detain the Court as to why the High Court did not decide both
the writ petitions together. However, it is our considered view that for a fuller and
complete adjudication of the matter the two writ petitions should have been heard
together so that the individual or the joint liability of the two Defendants i.e. Defendant
Nos. 6 and 7 could be properly adjudicated.
6 . In any event, the decision of this Court in the present appeal filed by the Bank
against the present Respondent would virtually foreclose the writ petition pending in the
High Court filed by the Bank as against Mr. V. Nandakumar (the new Director) and any
opinion expressed by this Court would work either to the prejudice or to the benefit of
the said Defendant i.e. Mr. V. Nandakumar against whom the writ proceeding instituted
by the Bank is presently pending.
7 . In the light of the above fact we are, therefore, of the view that we ought not to
decide the present appeal on merits but request the High Court to decide both the writ
petitions together. We accordingly set aside the order of the High Court on the above
stated grounds and request the High Court to act accordingly, namely, decide Writ
Petition No. 9590 of 2006 and Writ Petition No. 24303 of 2005 together as expeditiously
as its business would permit. We also make it clear that the High Court is free to decide
the matter in a manner as may be considered appropriate by it and we have expressed
no opinion on the contentions of either of the parties before us. The appeal
consequently is disposed of in the above terms and the order of the High Court is set
aside.","Appellants: Central Bank of India

Case Category:
MERCANTILE LAWS, COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING BANKING - MATTERS
RELATING TO RECOVERY OF DEBTS/ BANK LOANS DUE UNDER THE BANKS AND
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
Facts:
The sole Respondent, who, at the relevant point of time, was a Director of the
Company, had executed two personal guarantees against a financial
accommodation made available by the Appellant-Bank to the Company in
question. The Respondent resigned from the Board of Directors of the
Company and informed the Bank with a request to discharge the present
Respondent from the guarantees executed by him. The Bank intimated the
present Respondent that the matter was being examined at the appropriate
decision making level. The Director of the Company, who came in place of the
Respondent, also executed two personal guarantees which were accepted by
the Bank. As there was default in payment of the loan amount the Bank
instituted a suit for recovery. The Tribunal decreed the application of the Bank
but restricted the liability of the present Respondent to the amount of the two
guarantees in question.
The Respondent filed an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal which was
allowed. One of the grounds that prevailed upon the Appellate Tribunal to
allow the appeal of the Respondent was that the action of the Bank in
accepting the personal guarantees of the new Director amounted to
exoneration of the Respondent from the guarantees executed by him. The
order of the Appellate Tribunal was challenged by the Bank before the High
Court by filing a petition which was dismissed by the High Court on the said
ground, namely, the induction of new Director and the personal guarantees
executed by him exonerated the Respondent. Hence, the present appeal.
Held, while disposing off the appeal:
(i) In the suit filed by the Bank which was transferred to the Tribunal the
Respondent and the new Director were impleaded as the Defendant Nos. 6
and 7. The decree passed by the Tribunal made both the Defendant Nos. 6 and
7 jointly liable. They both filed separate appeals which were decided by the
Appellate Tribunal separately. Against which, the Bank had filed two separate
writ petitions. By the impugned order, while the petition filed by the Bank
against the Respondent was decided. The petition filed by the Bank against
the new Director was still pending consideration before the High Court and
was awaiting the outcome of the present appeal. Whether the guarantees
executed by the two Directors i.e. Defendant Nos. 6 and 7, both, continue to
remain in force or the acceptance of the one would work as exoneration of
the other could not have been decided in the writ petition filed by the Bank
against the Respondent without taking into consideration the writ petition
filed by the Bank against the new Director. For a fuller and complete
adjudication of the matter the two writ petitions should have been heard
together so that the individual or the joint liability of the two Defendants i.e.
Defendant Nos. 6 and 7 could be properly adjudicated. [5] and[6]
(ii) The High Court was requested to decide both the writ petitions together.

2. These appeals arise out of a judgment and order dated 2nd April, 2014 passed by the
High Court of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh at Guwahati in
Criminal Appeal No. 10 and Criminal Revision No. 41 both of the year 2012 whereby the
High Court has allowed the Criminal Revision No. 41 of 2012 and set aside the
conviction of Respondent Haren Mudoi Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments
Act, 1881 and dismissed Criminal Appeal No. 10 of 2012 filed by the
Complainant/Appellant.
3. The Complainant/Appellant in these appeals is a partner in M/s. Ayaan Consortium.
He entered into an agreement with one Nazimul Islam for construction of a multistoreyed
building over a certain parcel of land. It is not in dispute that the
Complainant/Appellant paid to Nazimul Islam in connection with the said agreement a
sum of Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakhs only). It is also not in dispute that the
agreement did not materialise in the execution of the work in question with the result
that the same was cancelled in terms of a Promissory Note dated 13th August, 2007
executed by Nazimul Islam in favour of the Complainant/Appellant. The Promissory
Note, apart from cancelling the agreement, promised to pay to the
Complainant/Appellant the amount of Rs. 10,00,000/- received by the executant
Nazimul Islam within a period of one month from the date the Promissory Note was
executed. What is important is that the Promissory Note further stipulated that the
amount of Rs. 10,00,000/- was being refunded by the executant in terms of five postdated
cheques dated 5th September, 2007, 7th September, 2007, 9th September, 2007,
11th September, 2007 and 13th September, 2007, the receipt whereof was
acknowledged by the Complainant/Appellant. The Promissory Note, at the same time,
somewhat contradicted itself when it mentioned that the cheques were being issued as a
security and shall be returned to Nazimul Islam when the amount of Rs. 10,00,000/- is
paid by him within a period of one month. Interest at the bank rates was also promised
to be paid on the said amount of Rs. 10,00,000/-.
4 . The cheques so received by the Complainant/Appellant appear to have been
presented for payment after the expiry of the period of one month stipulated for the
return of the amount when no such return was made to the Complainant/Appellant. All
the cheques were, however, dishonoured by the bank on the ground of insufficiency of
funds. A second presentation also proved abortive for the same reason. It was at this
stage that Respondent No. 2-Haren Mudoi appeared on the scene and indemnified the
Complainant/Appellant by acknowledging that the cheques in question were actually
issued by him and handed over to Nazimul Islam. This acknowledgment was reflected in
the form of an endorsement on the Promissory Note in which he agreed to the cheques
being presented for payment after 25th September, 2007. The Complainant/Appellant
accordingly once again presented the cheques for payment on 5th November, 2007 but
the same were dishonoured by the bank for the third time. This led to the issue of a
statutory notice by the Complainant/Appellant to which the Respondent sent a reply
through the lawyer denying that he had any knowledge of handing over of all the
cheques to the Complainant/Appellant by Nazimul Islam and also about the dishonour
of the cheques due to insufficiency of funds. What is significant is that, in the reply, the
Respondent undertook to pay the whole amount of Rs. 10,00,000/- by the second week
of January, 2008 by issuing fresh cheques.
5 . A complaint Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 was in the
above backdrop filed by the Appellant against both Nazimul Islam and Haren Mudoi.
Since Nazimul Islam had, in the meantime, passed away, proceedings against him
abated but the trial court found the Respondent guilty and accordingly convicted him for
the offence punishable Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and
sentenced him to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year. In addition,
the trial court awarded compensation to the Complainant/Appellant in a sum of Rs.
12,00,000/- to be paid within a period of three months.
6 . Aggrieved by the judgment and order passed by the trial court, the Respondent
preferred Criminal Appeal No. 9 of 2010 before Additional Sessions Judge, Kamrup at
Guwahati, who, while upholding the conviction of the Respondent modified the sentence
awarded to him to payment of a fine of Rs. 2,000/- (Rupees Two Thousand only) and, a
default sentence of imprisonment for a period of one month, in addition to the amount
of compensation awarded by the trial court. The sentence of imprisonment was, in that
view, set aside by the appellate court.
7. Criminal Appeal No. 10 of 2012 and Criminal Revision No. 41 of 2012 were then filed
before the High Court at Guwahati by the parties. While Criminal Appeal No. 10 of 2012
was filed by the Complainant/Appellant, Criminal Revision No. 41 of 2012 challenged
the conviction of the Respondent by the trial court and affirmed by the Appellate Court
for an offence Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The High
Court has, as seen earlier, set aside the conviction of the Respondent and allowed
Criminal Revision No. 41 of 2012 while dismissing Criminal Appeal No. 10 of 2012 in
terms of the judgment and order impugned in the present appeals.
8 . We have heard learned Counsel for the parties at some length who have taken us
through the orders passed by the courts below. We may at the outset gainfully extract
Promissory Note dated 13th August, 2007 executed by Nazimul Islam in favour of the
complainant in which the deceased Nazimul Islam had acknowledged his liability to
refund the amount of Rs. 10,00,000/- received by him from the Complainant/Appellant
in this appeal. The Promissory Note was in the following words:
PROMISSORY NOTE Dated 13.8.2007
I Shri Nazimul Islam s/o Late Sirajul Islam resident of Bishnu Rabha Path Beltola
do hereby declare that after mutual discussion between us (the parties) as per
agreement dated 06/07/07 have decided to cancel the said agreement and as
such the advance amount of Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakhs only) shall be
refunded within a period of one month from today. The amount is being
refunded vide cheques Nos. 191254 dated 05.09.2007, 191255 dated
07.09.2007, 191256 dated 09.09.2007, 191257 dated 11.09.2007 and cheque
No. 191258 dated 13.09.2007 which has been acknowledged by Mr. Dhan
Ayengia, resident of Nabagrah Road, Guwahati. It may here be mentioned that
these cheques have been issued as a security and shall be returned to me as
and when the payments are received from me, within the mentioned period.
Further it may be also be mentioned that one month's bank interest shall be paid
by me, after the payment is cleared, within the stipulated period.
(Nazimul Islam) 13.8.2007
9. We may also extract, at this stage, the endorsement which the Respondent made on
the Promissory Note acknowledging that the cheques handed over to the
Complainant/Appellant herein were actually issued by him and agreeing that the same
may be presented for payment after 25th September, 2007. The endorsement was in the
following manner:
The above cheques are issued by me to Nazimul Islam to deliver to Mr. Don
Ayengia the cheques are already been bounce. Now, we have requested Mr.
Dona Ayengia to represent the cheques after 25.09.2007 to contact me.
15.09.2007
(H. Mudoi)
10. It is not in dispute that the execution of the Promissory Note and the endorsement
made by the Respondent has been satisfactorily proved at the trial. Concurrent findings
recorded by the trial court and the first appellate court to that effect conclude the
factual part of the controversy. The only question that survives in the above background
is whether the cheques issued by the Respondent were meant to discharge, in whole or
part, ""any debt or other liability"" within the meaning of Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act, 1881.
11. We have no hesitation in answering that question in the affirmative. The facts as
narrated above and as held proved by the trial Court and the appellate court, leave no
manner of doubt, that Nazimul Islam had received an amount of rupees ten lakhs from
the complainant in connection with the agreement executed between the two. It is also
not in dispute that upon termination of the agreement, the amount paid to Nazimul
Islam was refundable to the complainant and that Nazimul Islam had agreed to refund
the same within one month. The promissory note executed by Nazimul Islam contained
an unequivocal acknowledgment of not only the debt/liability aforementioned but
promised to liquidate the same within one month with interest at the bank rate. Five
cheques handed over were to be returned but only upon payment of the amount in
question. Such being the fact situation, it cannot be said that the cheques had nothing
to do with any debt or other liability. As a matter of fact, the existence of the debt or
liability was never in dispute. On the contrary, it was acknowledged by Nazimul Islam
who simply sought one month's time to pay up the amount. The cheques were post
dated, only to give to the drawer the specified one month's time to pay the amount.
There is thus a direct relationship between the liability and the cheques issued in
connection therewith. Thus far there is no difficulty. The difficulty arises only because
the promissory note uses the words ""security"" qua the cheques. This would ordinarily
and in the context in which the cheques were given imply that once the amount of
rupees ten lakhs was paid, the cheques shall have to be returned. There would be no
reason for their retention by the complainant or for their presentation. In case,
however, the amount was not paid within the period stipulated, the cheques were liable
to be presented for otherwise there was no logic or reason for their having been issued
and handed over in the first instance. If non-payment of the agreed debt/liability within
the time specified also did not entitle the holder to present the cheques for payment,
the issue and delivery of any such cheques would be meaningless and futile if not
absurd. It is important to note that it was not a case where no debt or liability was
determined or acknowledged to be payable. If cheques were issued in relation to a
continuing contract or business where no claim is made on the date of the issue nor anydeterminate amount payable to the holder, one could perhaps argue that the cheques
cannot be presented or prosecution launched on a unilateral claim of any debt or
liability. The present is, however, a case where the existence of the debt/liability was
never in dispute. It was on the contrary acknowledged and a promise was made to
liquidate the same within one month. Failure on the part of the debtor to do so could
lead to only one result, viz. presentation of the cheques for payment and in the event of
dishonour, launch of prosecution as has indeed happened in the case at hand.
12. The argument that the Respondent had no liability to liquidate the debt owed by
Nazimul Islam, has not impressed us. What is important is whether the cheques were
supported by consideration. Besides the fact that there is a presumption that a
negotiable instrument is supported by consideration there was no dispute that such a
consideration existed in as much as the cheques were issued in connection with the
discharge of the outstanding liability against Nazimul Islam. At any rate the
endorsement made by the Respondent on the promissory note that the cheques can be
presented for encashment after 25-09-2007 clearly shows that the cheques issued by
him were not ornamental but were meant to be presented if the amount in question was
not paid within the extended period. The High Court in our view fell in error in upsetting
the conviction recorded by the Courts below who had correctly analysed the factual
situation and applied the law applicable to the same.
13. In the result, we allow these appeals and set aside the order passed by the High
Court to the extent it allowed Criminal Revision No. 41 of 2012 filed by the Respondent.
Consequently the order passed by the appellate court shall stand restored. We,
however, do not see any reason to interfere with the order passed by the High Court to
the extent it dismissed Criminal Appeal No. 10 of 2012. No costs.","Appellants: Don Ayengia

A complaint Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 was
in the above backdrop filed by the Appellant against both Nazimul Islam and
Haren Mudoi. Since Nazimul Islam had, in the meantime, passed away,
proceedings against him abated but the trial court found the Respondent
guilty and accordingly convicted him for the offence punishable Under Section
138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and sentenced him to undergo
simple imprisonment for a period of one year. In addition, the trial court
awarded compensation to the Complainant/Appellant in a sum of Rs.
12,00,000/- to be paid within a period of three months.
Aggrieved, the Respondent preferred Criminal Appeal before the Additional
Sessions Judge, who, while upholding the conviction of the Respondent
modified the sentence awarded to him to payment of a fine of Rs. 2000/- and,
a default sentence of imprisonment for a period of one month, in addition to
the amount of compensation awarded by trial court. The sentence of
imprisonment was, in that view, set aside by the appellate court.
Criminal Appeal was then filed by the Complainant/Appellant and Criminal
Revision was filed challenging the conviction of the Respondent by the trial
court and affirmed by the Appellate Court for an offence Under Section 138 of
the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The High Court, set aside the
conviction of the Respondent and allowed Criminal Revision while dismissing
Criminal Appeal in terms of the judgment and order impugned in the present
appeals.
Held, while allowing the appeals
It is not in dispute that the execution of the Promissory Note and the
endorsement made by the Respondent has been satisfactorily proved at the
trial. Concurrent findings recorded by the trial court and the first appellate
court to that effect conclude the factual part of the controversy. The only
question that survives in the above background is whether the cheques issued
by the Respondent were meant to discharge, in whole or part, ""any debt or
other liability"" within the meaning of Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act, 1881.[10]
The Court had no hesitation in answering that question in the affirmative.
The facts as narrated above and as held proved by the trial Court and the
appellate court, leave no manner of doubt, that Nazimul Islam had received
an amount of rupees ten lakhs from the complainant in connection with the
agreement executed between the two. It is also not in dispute that upon
termination of the agreement, the amount paid to Nazimul Islam was
refundable to the complainant and that Nazimul Islam had agreed to refund
the same within one month. The promissory note executed by Nazimul Islam
contained an unequivocal acknowledgment of not only the debt/liability
aforementioned but promised to liquidate the same within one month with
interest at the bank rate. Five cheques handed over were to be returned but
only upon payment of the amount in question. Such being the fact situation,
it cannot be said that the cheques had nothing to do with any debt or other
liability.[11]
As a matter of fact, the existence of the debt or liability was never in dispute.
On the contrary, it was acknowledged by Nazimul Islam who simply sought
one month's time to pay up the amount. The cheques were post dated, only to
give to the drawer the specified one month's time to pay the amount. There is
thus a direct relationship between the liability and the cheques issued in
connection therewith. Thus far there is no difficulty. The difficulty arises only
because the promissory note uses the words ""security"" qua the cheques. This
would ordinarily and in the context in which the cheques were given imply
that once the amount of rupees ten lakhs was paid, the cheques shall have to

the period stipulated, the cheques were liable to be presented for otherwise
there was no logic or reason for their having been issued and handed over in
the first instance. If non-payment of the agreed debt/liability within the time
specified also did not entitle the holder to present the cheques for payment,
the issue and delivery of any such cheques would be meaningless and futile if
not absurd.[11]
It is important to note that it was not a case where no debt or liability was
determined or acknowledged to be payable. If cheques were issued in relation
to a continuing contract or business where no claim is made on the date of
the issue nor any determinate amount payable to the holder, one could
perhaps argue that the cheques cannot be presented or prosecution launched
on a unilateral claim of any debt or liability. The present is, however, a case
where the existence of the debt/liability was never in dispute. It was on the
contrary acknowledged and a promise was made to liquidate the same within
one month. Failure on the part of the debtor to do so could lead to only one
result, viz. presentation of the cheques for payment and in the event of
dishonour, launch of prosecution as has indeed happened in the case at hand.
[11]
The argument that the Respondent had no liability to liquidate the debt owed
by Nazimul Islam, did not impress the Court. What is important is whether the
cheques were supported by consideration. Besides the fact that there is a
presumption that a negotiable instrument is supported by consideration there
was no dispute that such a consideration existed in as much as the cheques
were issued in connection with the discharge of the outstanding liability
against Nazimul Islam. At any rate the endorsement made by the Respondent
on the promissory note that the cheques can be presented for encashment
after 25-09-2007 clearly shows that the cheques issued by him were not
ornamental but were meant to be presented if the amount in question was
not paid within the extended period. The High Court in Court's view fell in
error in upsetting the conviction recorded by the Courts below who had
correctly analysed the factual situation and applied the law applicable to the
same.[12]
In the result, the Court allowed these appeals and set aside the order passed
by the High Court to the extent it allowed Criminal Revision filed by the
Respondent. Consequently the order passed by the appellate court shall stand
restored. The Court, however, did not see any reason to interfere with the
order passed by the High Court to the extent it dismissed Criminal Appeal.

there is a legislative embargo on the sale of mortgaged properties by the bank to any
person who is not a member of a scheduled tribe. The auction purchasers in the present
case happened to be the persons who are not members of any scheduled tribe.
3 . The High Court by the impugned order answered the writ petition in favour of the
Respondents/writ Petitioners on the ground that the Tripura Act of 1960 being included
in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution and, therefore, enjoying the protection of
Section 31B of the Constitution, would prevail over the Act of 2002 so as to invalidate
the sale Notification dated 26.06.2012, the same being contrary to the provisions of
Section 187 of the Tripura Act of 1960.
4. It will not require much appreciation or scrutiny to come to the conclusion that the
High Court was wholly incorrect in answering the writ petition and striking down the
sale Notification dated 26.06.2012 on the above basis. Article 31B of the Constitution,
on the very face of the language contained therein, is self explanatory and provides
protection/immunity to a legislation from challenge on the ground that it violates any of
the provisions of Part III of the Constitution. Inclusion of the Tripura Act of 1960 in the
Ninth Schedule by itself, would, therefore, not confer immunity to the said legislation
from being overridden by the provisions of a Parliamentary statute. This is a question,
therefore, that this Court will have to deal with notwithstanding the fact that the
proceedings before the High Court did not proceed on the aforesaid basis. We had,
therefore, permitted the learned Counsels of both sides to address us on the core
question arising in the present appeals, namely, whether the Act of 2002 insofar as it
provides for sale of immovable properties offered as security for a loan advanced,
without any restriction as to the class or category of buyers, would prevail
notwithstanding the restrictive provision in this regard Under Section 187 of the Tripura
Act of 1960.
5. Shri Mukul Rohatgi, the learned Attorney General for India appearing on behalf of the
Appellant-Bank and Shri V. Giri, learned senior Counsel representing the auctionpurchasers
in the connected appeal have contended that the purpose and object of the
Act of 2002 is to regulate securitisation and reconstruction of financial assets and
enforcement of security interest and for matters connected therewith. On the other
hand, the purpose of the Tripura Act of 1960 is to consolidate the law relating to land
revenue and to provide for the acquisition of estates and for certain other measures of
land reform. While the Act of 2002 enacted by the Union Parliament is referable to Entry
45 of List I, the Tripura Act can be traced to Entries 18 and 45 of the State List. Section
187 of the Tripura Act puts an embargo on the sale of hypothecated/mortgaged
properties by a bank to any person who is not a tribal. Therefore, the provisions of the
Tripura Act of 1960 deal with a crucial aspect of the subject of banking. Reference in
this regard is made to the provision of Section 13 of the Act of 2002 which permits the
secured creditor to enforce the security interest without the intervention of the Court.
The sale of the property of any person, offered to a bank as security for any financial
facility, so as to recover the dues of the Bank is a part of the core banking activity of
any bank. The dominant legislation so far as banking is concerned, in the present case,
is the Act of 2002 enacted by the Union Parliament and not the State Act. On the said
basis, it is contended that by virtue of Article 246(1) of the Constitution, the Act of
2002, so far as sale of mortgaged properties by the bank is concerned, would prevail
over Section 187 of the Tripura Act of 1960. The said provisions of the State Act must
give way to the provisions of the Central Act, it is urged.
6. Learned Counsels for the Respondents/writ Petitioners, in reply, have contended that
the provisions of both the statutes can co-exist and run parallelly without any conflict.
It is urged that, in fact, there is no conflict between the two. Section 187 of the Tripura
Act of 1960 does not prohibit or impose a complete embargo on the sale of mortgaged
properties. Only when the borrower is a tribal the sale by the Bank has also to be to a
tribal.
7. Repugnancy or inconsistency between the provisions of Central and State enactments
can occur in two situations. The first, in case of a Central and a State Act on any field of
entry mentioned in List III of the Seventh Schedule (Concurrent List). To such a
situation of repugnancy or inconsistency, the provisions of Article 254 of the
Constitution would apply. If there is such an inconsistency, Article 254(1) makes it very
clear that the central law will prevail subject, however, to the provisions of Article
254(2) and further subject to proviso to Article 254(2). The above position would be
clear from the opinion rendered by a three Judges Bench of this Court in M/s. Hoechst
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Ors. v. State of Bihar and Ors. MANU/SC/0392/1983 :
(1983) 4 SCC 45 Para 67 of the aforesaid opinion which may be usefully noticed is in
the following terms:
67. Article 254 of the Constitution makes provision first, as to what would
happen in the case of conflict between a Central and State law with regard to
the subjects enumerated in the Concurrent List, and secondly, for resolving
such conflict. Article 254(1) enunciates the normal Rule that in the event of a
conflict between a Union and a State law in the concurrent field, the former
prevails over the latter. Clause (1) lays down that if a State law relating to a
concurrent subject is 'repugnant' to a Union law relating to that subject, then,
whether the Union law is prior or later in time, the Union law will prevail and
the State law shall, to the extent of such repugnancy, be void. To the general
Rule laid down in Clause (1), Clause (2) engrafts an exception viz., that if the
President assents to a State law which has been reserved for his consideration,
it will prevail notwithstanding its repugnancy to an earlier law of the Union,
both laws dealing with a concurrent subject. In such a case, the Central Act,
will give way to the State Act only to the extent of inconsistency between the
two, and no more. In short, the result of obtaining the assent of the President
to a State Act which is inconsistent with a previous Union law relating to a
concurrent subject would be that the State Act will prevail in that State and
override the provisions of the Central Act in their applicability to that State
only. The predominance of the State law may however be taken away if
Parliament legislates under the proviso to Clause (2). The proviso to Article
254(2) empowers the Union Parliament to repeal or amend a repugnant State
law, either directly, or by itself enacting a law repugnant to the State law with
respect to the 'same matter'. Even though the subsequent law made by
Parliament does not expressly repeal a State law, even then, the State law will
become void as soon as the subsequent law of Parliament creating repugnancy
is made. A State law would be repugnant to the Union law when there is direct
conflict between the two laws. Such repugnancy may also arise where both
laws operate in the same field and the two cannot possibly stand together: See
Zaverbhai Amaidas v. State of Bombay MANU/SC/0040/1954 : (1955) 1 SCR
799; M. Karunanidhi v. Union of India MANU/SC/0159/1979 : (1979) 3 SCR 254
and T. Barai v. Henry Ah Hoe MANU/SC/0123/1982 : (1983) 1 SCC 177.
8. The above view has been reiterated in State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd.
and Ors. MANU/SC/0038/2004 : (2004) 10 SCC 201 There are several other
pronouncements of this Court on the aforesaid issue. The same, however, would not
require any mention as any such reference would be only a multiplication of discussions
on what appears to be a settled issue. In the present case, however, the question before
this Court is not one of repugnancy between a Central and a State law relatable to an
Entry in List III (Concurrent List). No further attention to the above aspect of the matter
would, therefore, be required.
9 . The second situation of repugnancy or inconsistency as in the present case is
between to a subsequent Central law (Act of 2002) covered by Entry 45 of List I and an
earlier State law (Tripura Act of 1960) relatable to Entries 18 and 45 of List II. How
such a situation is to be resolved and answered and which legislation would have
primacy is the moot question that arises for consideration in the present appeals.
10. Article 246 of the Constitution of India is in the following terms.
246. Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and by the
Legislatures of States:
(1) Notwithstanding anything in Clauses (2) and (3), Parliament has exclusive
power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in
the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the 'Union List')
(2) Notwithstanding anything in Clause (3), Parliament and, subject to Clause
(1), the Legislature of any State also, have power to make laws with respect to
any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule (in this
Constitution referred to as the 'Concurrent List')
(3) Subject to Clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State has exclusive
power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of
the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution
referred to as the 'State List')
(4) Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part
of the territory of India not included (in a State) notwithstanding that such
matter is a matter enumerated in the State List.
11. In interpreting Article 246 regard must be had to the constitutional scheme which
visualises a federal structure giving full autonomy to the Union Parliament as well as to
the State legislatures in their respective/demarcated fields of legislation. The problem
may, however, become a little more complex than what may seemingly appear as the
two legislations may very well be within the respective domains of the concerned
legislatures and, yet, there may be intrusion into areas that fall beyond the assigned
fields of legislation. In such a situation it will be plain duty of the Constitutional Court
to see if the conflict can be resolved by acknowledging the mutual existence of the two
legislations. If that is not possible, then by virtue of the provisions of Article 246(1),
the Parliamentary legislation would prevail and the State legislation will have to give
way notwithstanding the fact that the State legislation is within the demarcated field
(List II). This is the principle of federal supremacy which Article 246 of the Constitution
embodies. The said principle will, however, prevail provided the pre-condition exists,
namely, the Parliamentary legislation is the dominant legislation and the State
legislation, though within its own field, has the effect of encroaching on a vital sphere
of the subject or entry to which the dominant legislation is referable. This is the
principle that is discernible from the Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in State
of West Bengal and Ors. v. Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights,
West Bengal and Ors. MANU/SC/0121/2010 : (2010) 3 SCC 571 Paragraphs 25, 26
and 27 which illuminates the issue may be conveniently extracted below.
25. The non obstante Clause in Article 246(1) contemplates the predominance
or supremacy of the Union Legislature. This power is not encumbered by
anything contained in Clauses (2) and (3) for these clauses themselves are
expressly limited and made subject to the non obstante Clause in Article
246(1). The State Legislature has exclusive power to make laws for such State
or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in
the Seventh Schedule and it also has the power to make laws with respect to
any matters enumerated in List III (Concurrent List). The exclusive power of the
State Legislature to legislate with respect to any of the matters enumerated in
List II has to be exercised subject to Clause (1) i.e. the exclusive power of
Parliament to legislate with respect to matters enumerated in List I. As a
consequence, if there is a conflict between an entry in List I and an entry in List
II, which is not capable of reconciliation, the power of Parliament to legislate
with respect to a matter enumerated in List II must supersede pro tanto the
exercise of power of the State Legislature.
26. Both Parliament and the State Legislature have concurrent powers of
legislation with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III. The words
""notwithstanding anything contained in Clauses (2) and (3)"" in Article 246(1)
and the words ""subject to Clauses (1) and (2)"" in Article 246(3) lay down the
principle of federal supremacy viz. that in case of inevitable conflict between
the Union and State powers, the Union power as enumerated in List I shall
prevail over the State power as enumerated in Lists II and III and in case of an
overlapping between Lists II and III, the latter shall prevail.
27. Though, undoubtedly, the Constitution exhibits supremacy of Parliament
over the State Legislatures, yet the principle of federal supremacy laid down in
Article 246 of the Constitution cannot be resorted to unless there is an
irreconcilable direct conflict between the entries in the Union and the State
Lists. Thus, there is no quarrel with the broad proposition that under the
Constitution there is a clear demarcation of legislative powers between the
Union and the States and they have to confine themselves within the field
entrusted to them. It may also be borne in mind that the function of the lists is
not to confer powers; they merely demarcate the legislative field....
12. Equally illuminating is the view available in the opinion of this Court rendered In
Re. Special Reference No. 1 of 2001 (2004) 4 SCC 489, which is reproduced below.
13. The Constitution of India delineates the contours of the powers enjoyed by
the State Legislature and Parliament in respect of various subjects enumerated
in the Seventh Schedule. The Rules relating to distribution of powers are to be
gathered from the various provisions contained in Part XI and the legislative
heads mentioned in the three lists of the Schedule. The legislative powers of
both the Union and State Legislatures are given in precise terms. Entries in the
lists are themselves not powers of legislation, but fields of legislation.
However, an entry in one list cannot be so interpreted as to make it cancel or
obliterate another entry or make another entry meaningless. In case of apparent
conflict, it is the duty of the court to iron out the crease and avoid conflict by
reconciling the conflict. If any entry overlaps or is in apparent conflict with
another entry, every attempt shall be made to harmonise the same.
14. When the question arose about reconciling Entry 45 of List I, duties of
excise, and Entry 18 of List II, taxes on the sale of goods, of the Government of
India Act, 1935, Sir Maurice Gwyer, C.J. in Central Provinces and Berar Act No.
XIV of 1938, In re, (1939) FCR 18, at pp. 42-44 observed:
A grant of the power in general terms, standing by itself, would no
doubt be construed in the wider sense, but it may be qualified by other
express provisions in the same enactment, by the implications of the
context, and even by considerations arising out of what appears to be
the general scheme of the Act.
It was further observed:
An endeavour must be made to solve it, as the Judicial Committee have
said, by having recourse to the context and scheme of the Act, and a
reconciliation attempted between two apparently conflicting
jurisdictions by reading the two entries together and by interpreting,
and, where necessary modifying the language of the one by that of the
other. If indeed such a reconciliation should prove impossible, then,
and only then, will the non obstante Clause operate and the federal
power prevail;
15. Although Parliament cannot legislate on any of the entries in the State List,
it may do so incidentally while essentially dealing with the subject coming
within the purview of the entry in the Union List. Conversely, the State
Legislature also while making legislation may incidentally trench upon the
subject covered in the Union List. Such incidental encroachment in either event
need not make the legislation ultra vires the Constitution. The doctrine of pith
and substance is sometimes invoked to find out the nature and content of the
legislation. However, when there is an irreconcilable conflict between the two
legislations, the Central legislation shall prevail. However, every attempt would
be made to reconcile the conflict.
13. The federal structure under the constitutional scheme can also work to nullify an
incidental encroachment made by the Parliamentary legislation on a subject of a State
legislation where the dominant legislation is the State legislation. An attempt to keep
the aforesaid constitutional balance intact and give a limited operation to the doctrine of
federal supremacy can be discerned in the concurring judgment of Ruma Pal, J. in ITC
Ltd. v. Agricultural Produce Market Committee and Ors. MANU/SC/0047/2002 :
(2002) 9 SCC 232, wherein after quoting the observations of this Court in the case of
S.R. Bomai v. Union of India MANU/SC/0444/1994 : (1994) 3 SCC 1 (para 276), the
learned Judge has gone to observe as follows (para 94 of the report):
276. The fact that under the scheme of our Constitution, greater power is
conferred upon the Centre vis-Ã -vis the States does not mean that States are
mere appendages of the Centre. Within the sphere allotted to them, States are
supreme. The Centre cannot tamper with their powers. More particularly, the
courts should not adopt an approach, an interpretation, which has the effect of
or tends to have the effect of whittling down the powers reserved to the States.
94. Although Parliament cannot legislate on any of the entries in the State List,
it may do so incidentally while essentially legislating within the entries under
the Union List. Conversely, the State Legislatures may encroach on the Union
List, when such an encroachment is merely ancillary to an exercise of power
intrinsically under the State List. The fact of encroachment does not affect the
vires of the law even as regards the area of encroachment. [A.S. Krishna v.
State of Madras MANU/SC/0035/1956 : AIR 1957 SC 297; Chaturbhai M. Patel
v. Union of India MANU/SC/0012/1959 : (1960) 2 SCR 362; State of Rajasthan
v. G. Chawla MANU/SC/0141/1958 : AIR 1959 SC 544; Ishwari Khetan Sugar
Mills (P) Ltd. v. State of U.P. MANU/SC/0069/1980 : (1980) 4 SCC 136]. This
principle commonly known as the doctrine of pith and substance, does not
amount to an extension of the legislative fields. Therefore, such incidental
encroachment in either event does not deprive the State Legislature in the first
case or Parliament in the second, of their exclusive powers under the entry so
encroached upon. In the event the incidental encroachment conflicts with
legislation actually enacted by the dominant power, the dominant legislation
will prevail.
1 4 . The aforesaid view in the concurring judgment of Ruma Pal, J. in ITC Ltd. v.
Agricultural Produce Market Committee and Ors. (supra), seems to have been
echoed in a recent pronouncement of this Court in Vishal N. Kalsaria v. Bank of
India and Ors. MANU/SC/0061/2016 : (2016) 3 SCC 762, wherein this Court had held
that the provisions of the Act of 2002 will not have an overriding effect on the
provisions of the State Rent Control Acts.
15. In the present case the conflict between the Central and the State Act is on account
of an apparent overstepping by the provisions of the State Act dealing with land reform
into an area of banking covered by the Central Act. The test, therefore, would be to find
out as to which is the dominant legislation having regard the area of encroachment.
1 6 . The provisions of the Act of 2002 enable the bank to take possession of any
property where a security interest has been created in its favour. Specifically, Section
13 of the 2002 Act enables the bank to take possession of and sell such property to any
person to realise its dues. The purchaser of such property acquires a clear title to the
property sold, subject to compliance with the requirements prescribed.
17. Section 187 of the Tripura Act of 1960, on the other hand, prohibits the bank from
transferring the property which has been mortgaged by a member of a scheduled tribe
to any person other than a member of a scheduled tribe. This is a clear restriction on
what is permitted by the Act of 2002 for the realisation of amounts due to the bank.
18. The Act of 2002 is relatable to the Entry of banking which is included in List I of the
Seventh Schedule. Sale of mortgaged property by a bank is an inseparable and integral
part of the business of banking. The object of the State Act, as already noted, is an
attempt to consolidate the land revenue law in the State and also to provide measures
of agrarian reforms. The field of encroachment made by the State legislature is in the
area of banking. So long there did not exist any parallel Central Act dealing with sale of
secured assets and referable to Entry 45 of List I, the State Act, including Section 187,
operated validly. However, the moment Parliament stepped in by enacting such a law
traceable to Entry 45 and dealing exclusively with activities relating to sale of secured
assets, the State law, to the extent that it is inconsistent with the Act of 2002, must give
way. The dominant legislation being the Parliamentary legislation, the provisions of the
Tripura Act of 1960, pro tanto, (Section 187) would be invalid. It is the provisions of
the Act of 2002, which do not contain any embargo on the category of persons to whom
mortgaged property can be sold by the bank for realisation of its dues that will prevail
over the provisions contained in Section 187 of the Tripura Act of 1960.
19. The decision of this Court in Central Bank of India v. State of Kerala and Ors.
MANU/SC/0306/2009 : (2009) 4 SCC 94, holding that the provisions of the Bombay
Sales Tax Act, 1959 and the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963 providing for a first
charge on the property of the person liable to pay sales tax, in favour of the State, is
not inconsistent with the provisions contained in the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks
and Financial Institutions, Act 1993 (for short the ""DRT Act"") and also the Act of 2002
must be understood by noticing the absence of any specific provision in either of the
Central enactments containing a similar/parallel provision of a first charge in favour of
the bank. The judgment of this Court holding the State enactments to be valid and the
Central enactments not to have any overriding effect, proceeds on the said basis i.e.
absence of any provision creating a first charge in favour of the bank in either of the
Central enactments.
20. The High Court in the judgment under challenge has also taken the view that the
impugned sale Notification dated 26.06.2012 is invalid for infraction of Rule 5 and Rule
8(5) of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002, in as much as the bank did not
obtain any valuation report of the property before resorting to the impugned auction
sale. The Rules in question read as follows.
5. Valuation of movable secured assets.-
After taking possession under Sub-rule (1) of Rule 4 and in any case
before sale, the authorised officer shall obtain the estimated value of
the movable secured assets and thereafter, if considered necessary, fix
in consultation with the secured creditor, the reserve price of the assets
to be sold in realisation of the dues of the secured creditor.
8. Sale of immovable secured assets.-
(5) Before effecting sale of the immovable property referred to in Subrule
(1) of Rule 9, the authorised officer shall obtain valuation of the
property from an approved valuer and in consultation with the secured
creditor, fix the reserve price of the property and may sell the whole or
any part of such immovable secured asset by any of the following
methods:
21. Our attention had been specifically drawn to the stand of the Appellant-Bank before
the High Court in the counter filed (paragraph 20). Taking into account the averments
made in the said affidavit, we find that the sale proclamation had mentioned a reserve
price of Rs. 275 lacs and the property had been actually sold by auction at Rs. 416 lacs.
That apart, the valuation report dated 14.06.2012 of the approved valuer valuing the
property at Rs. 341.15 lacs has also been placed before us by way of an additional
document which we are inclined to take on record. The requirements under Rule 5 and
Rule 8(5) have, therefore, been complied with and the sale proclamation and the sale
effected pursuant thereto cannot be invalidated on the above ground.
22. For the aforesaid reasons, the impugned order passed by the High Court has to be
set aside which we hereby do. The appeals are consequently allowed. There will,
however, be no order as to costs.","Appellants: UCO Bank and Ors.

Case Category:
MERCANTILE LAWS, COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING BANKING - MATTERS
RELATING TO SECURITISATION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND
REINFORCEMENT OF SECURITY INTEREST ACT, 2002
Facts:
The petition was instituted before the High Court. The
Petitioners/Respondents were members of Scheduled Tribe(s) of the State.
They had contended that the Sale Notification issued by the Appellant Bank
under the provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial
Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 was in infraction of
Section 187 of the Tripura Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960 as
under the Act, 1960 there is a legislative embargo on the sale of mortgaged
properties by the bank to any person who is not a member of a scheduled
tribe. The auction purchasers happened to be the persons who are not
members of any scheduled tribe. The High Court answered the petition in
favour of the Respondents on the ground that the Act, 1960 being included in
the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution and, therefore, enjoying the protection
of Section 31B of the Constitution, would prevail over the Act, 2002 so as to
invalidate the Sale Notification, the same being contrary to the provisions of
Section 187 of the Act, 1960. Hence, the present appeal.
Held, while allowing the appeal:
(i) Repugnancy or inconsistency between the provisions of Central and State
enactments can occur in two situations. The first, in case of a Central and a
State Act on any field of entry mentioned in List III of the Seventh Schedule
(Concurrent List). The second situation of repugnancy or inconsistency as in
the present case is between to a subsequent Central law/Act, 2002 covered
by Entry 45 of List I and an earlier State law/Act, 1960) relatable to Entries
18 and 45 of List II. [7] and[9]
(ii) The conflict between the Central and the State Act is on account of an
apparent overstepping by the provisions of the State Act dealing with land
reform into an area of banking covered by the Central Act. The test, therefore,
would be to find out as to which is the dominant legislation having regard the
area of encroachment. [15]
(iii) The provisions of the Act, 2002 enable the bank to take possession of any
property where a security interest has been created in its favour. Specifically,
Section 13 of the Act, 2002 enables the bank to take possession of and sell
such property to any person to realise its dues. The purchaser of such property
acquires a clear title to the property sold, subject to compliance with the
requirements prescribed. Section 187 of the Act, 1960, on the other hand,
prohibits the bank from transferring the property which has been mortgaged
by a member of a scheduled tribe to any person other than a member of a
scheduled tribe. This is a clear restriction on what is permitted by the Act,
2002 for the realisation of amounts due to the bank. [16] and[17]
(iv) The moment Parliament stepped in by enacting such a law traceable to
Entry 45 and dealing exclusively with activities relating to sale of secured
assets, the State law, to the extent that it is inconsistent with the Act, 2002,
must give way. The dominant legislation being the Parliamentary legislation,
the provisions of the Act, 1960, pro tanto, Section 187 would be invalid. It is
the provisions of the Act, 2002, which do not contain any embargo on the
category of persons to whom mortgaged property can be sold by the bank for
realisation of its dues that will prevail over the provisions contained in
Section 187 of the Act, 1960. [18]
(v) The property was sold by auction at higher rate compare to reserve price
mentioned in sale proclamation. That apart, the valuation report of the
approved valuer valuing the property was also been placed. The requirements
under Rule 5 and Rule 8(5) of the Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules,
2002 were complied with and the sale proclamation and the sale effected
pursuant thereto could not be invalidated. The impugned order passed by the
High Court was set aside. [22]",,,,

the managing director of NORTON. It appears from the record that the Appellant is also
a director of a company known as M/s. Dakshin Granites Pvt. Ltd. (hereafter DAKSHIN).
3. The Respondent herein filed a complaint on 08.10.2012 bearing CC No. 2925 of 2012
on the file of the VII Metropolitan Magistrate, George Town at Chennai against the
Appellant herein invoking Sections 138 and 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881
(hereinafter referred to as ""THE ACT""). The substance of the complaint is that the
Appellant herein drew a cheque bearing No. 064159 dated 10.8.2012 for a sum of Rs.
39 lakhs (Rs. 39,00,000/-) on the Syndicate Bank, Armenian Street, Chennai in favour
of the Respondent. According to the complaint, the said amount of Rs. 39 lakhs is the
amount due from the Appellant towards the balance of the sale consideration in
connection with the sale transactions referred to above.
4 . The said cheque was presented for collection by the Respondent through his bank
(Indian Bank, High Court Branch, Chennai) on 28.8.2012 which was dishonoured on the
ground that the account on which the cheque was drawn had been closed.
5. On 10.9.2012, the Respondent issued a notice contemplated under Clause (b) of the
proviso to Section 138 of THE ACT. By the said notice, the Appellant was informed that
the cheque had been dishonored and further the Appellant was called upon to pay the
sum of Rs. 39 lakhs within 15 days from the date of the receipt of the notice. According
to the complaint, the notice was served on the Petitioner on 14.9.2012 but the Petitioner
neither responded to the notice nor made the payment. Hence the complaint.
6 . On 19.8.2015, Crl.M.P. No. 6771 of 2015 came to be filed in the above-mentioned
CC No. 2925 of 2012 by the Respondent herein purporting to be an application Under
Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short ""CrPC"") with prayer as
follows:
3 . In the above circumstances, it is therefore prayed that this Hon'ble Court
may be pleased to implead M/s. DAKSHIN GRANITES PVT. LTD., No. 3B,
EEBROS Centre, 40, Montieth Road, Chennai - 600 008 as Accused A1, in C.C.
No. 2925 of 2012 pending on the file of this Hon'ble Court and thus render
justice.
7. According to the said application, it came to the notice of the Respondent during the
course of cross-examination of the Appellant herein at the trial of the CC No. 2925 of
2012 that the cheque in question was drawn on the account of DAKSHIN and the
Appellant is only a signatory on behalf of the DAKSHIN in his capacity as a Director of
DAKSHIN. The Respondent had initially failed to lodge the complaint against DAKSHIN
by inadvertence and hence the application.
8. The application was contested by the Appellant. The learned Metropolitan Magistrate
by his Order dated 21.4.2016 allowed the said application. The Petitioner carried the
matter in Criminal R.C. No. 774 of 2016 to the Madras High Court unsuccessfully. Hence
the instant SLP.
9. Xerox copies of the three sale deeds are placed before us and according to the said
documents, the sale consideration for the three sale deeds is Rs. 2,80,000/-, Rs.
2,50,000/- and Rs. 1,20,000/-, in all Rs. 6,50,000/-. Nonetheless, the Respondent filed
the complaint stating that the cheque in question for Rs. 39 lakhs was drawn towards
the balance of the sale consideration of the transactions covered by the abovementioned
three sale deeds. Prima facie, it is very doubtful whether the cheque was
drawn for any amount which is legally due to the Respondent from the Appellant.
10. A xerox copy of the cheque is placed before us. The number of the account on
which the cheque was drawn is not very clear from the said copy. But from the content
of the application from out of which the instant appeal arises and from the xerox copy
of the cheque it appears that it was drawn on the account of DAKSHIN by somebody
who claims to be a Director of DAKSHIN. It is a case of the Respondent that the cheque
was signed by the Appellant. There appears to be some dispute regarding the identity of
the person who signed the cheque. It can be seen from para 2 of the complaint, the said
cheque was handed over to the Respondent through ""an unknown person at Chennai
High Court premises"".
11. Assuming for the sake of argument that an amount of Rs. 39 lakhs was due towards
the balance of the sale consideration of the above-mentioned three sales from the FIRM
of which the Appellant is said to be the Managing Partner. The cheque in question was
drawn by a private company (DAKSHIN) (a third party to the sale transactions and such
a payment is permissible under the Indian Contract Act) and allegedly signed by the
Appellant in his capacity as the Director of DAKSHIN.
12. The learned Counsel for the Appellant argued;
(a) Since the cheque in question was drawn on the account of DAKSHIN, the
person primarily liable for punishment Under Section 138 of THE ACT would be
DAKSHIN. The Appellant herein being the alleged signatory in his capacity as
the Director of DAKSHIN would only be vicariously liable (if at all) for the
offence committed by DAKSHIN. In view of the law declared by this Court in
Aneeta Hada1 the prosecution against the Appellant could not be successfully
maintained without prosecuting DAKSHIN. Since the complaint was originally
lodged only against the Appellant, the Respondent resorted to the device of
filing an application on 19.8.2015 Under Section 319 Code of Criminal
Procedure to 'implead' (in substance summon) DAKSHIN as an
Accused/Respondent to the complaint.
(b) Section 142(1)(a) of THE ACT inter alia stipulates that a complaint
regarding the commission of the offence Under Section 138 must be ""made
within one month of the date on which the cause of action arises under Clause
(c) of the proviso to Section 138"". The application Under Section 319 of Code
of Criminal Procedure by which DAKSHIN is sought to be impleaded
(summoned) is in substance a complaint against DAKSHIN which is filed some
three years after the expiry of the period of 15 days stipulated under Clause (c)
of the proviso to Section 138. Therefore barred by the stipulation contained in
Section 141(1)(b) of THE ACT. No valid explanation for condoning such a long
delay is offered by the Respondent. Both the courts below erred in coming to
the conclusion that once the offence is taken cognizance of, the question of
delay does not arise.
(c) Section 1382 stipulates inter alia that (i) the payee of the cheque must give
a notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque within 30 days from the ""receipt
of the information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as
unpaid""; (ii) the notice must contain a demand for the payment of the amount
due on the cheque; and (iii) upon the receipt of the notice, if the drawer of the
cheque fails to make payment within 15 days of the receipt of the notice,
prosecution could be launched within one month thereafter. The timelines
stipulated under Clauses (a) to (c) of the proviso to Section 138 are
mandatory.3
(d) The (instant) application Under Section 319 Code of Criminal Procedure
came to be filed (on 19.08.2015) some three years after the dishonour of the
cheque by the bank (on 30.8.2012). If the Respondent were to file complaint
Under Section 138 against DAKSHIN on 19.8.2015, such a complaint would be
clearly not maintainable as it would have been far beyond the permissible time
within which a complaint could have been filed Under Section 138 of THE ACT.
Therefore, both the courts below erred in allowing the application.
13. On the other hand, the learned Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the trial
court and the High Court rightly impleaded the Appellant. The learned Counsel
submitted that the proviso to Clause (b) of Section 142 of THE ACT enables the Court to
take cognizance of the offence even beyond the prescribed period of limitation, if the
complainant satisfies the Court that he had sufficient cause for not making the
complaint within the period of limitation. The Respondent only got to know that the
cheque in question was drawn on the account of DAKSHIN only during the course of
trial. Therefore, the Respondent made out a case for condonation of the delay.
14. It is rather difficult to understand the decision of the trial court. We are given to
understand that the order is made in vernacular and only a translated copy4 of the same
is placed before us. Be that as it may, the 'relevant' portion of the translated copies
reads as follows:
Hence whether cheque was drawn by company trial on the complaint can be
possible only if company is impleaded in complaint.
Hence as far as this case on hand, without impleading Dakshin Granite (P) Ltd.
trial can not be conducted for impleading the company and conditions as per
Section 138 should be fulfilled. As per Section 138 Notice has been sent to
Dakshin Granites - hence conditions fulfilled.
It is prayed by complainant that he should be permitted to implead company
and also condone the delay.
As per Section 142, complaint is to be filed with one month which has been
done. Hence as per Section 142(b) no separate petition is required after
cognizance of offence.
The offenders of crime can be decided. To take cognisance it is not required to
take cognizance in the case of each Accused.
In view of the above the petition is allowed and I order for impleading the
company and summons to be served.
15. While examining the legality of the trial court's order, the High Court took note of
the fact that two applications were filed by the Respondent, one to condone the delay
(of 1211 days) and other to implead (summon?) DAKSHIN invoking Section 319 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure. The High Court recorded an interesting finding:
In this case, the present revision is preferred only against the order passed in
Crl.M.P. No. 6771 of 2015 in C.C. No. 2925 of 2012, which was filed to implead
M/s. Dakshin Granites Private Ltd., as an Accused in the private complaint and
no appeal or revision was preferred against the order passed in Crl.M.P. No.
1257 of 2016 by either side.
16. We say it is an interesting finding because from the translation of the trial court's
order placed before us, the trial court is silent about the application for condonation of
the delay. On the other hand, the trial court observed ""Hence as per Section 142(b) no
separate petition is required after cognizance of offence.""
After recording such a finding, the High Court proceeded to say;
...The Trial Court, after considering the arguments of both sides, came
to a conclusion that since the case was already taken on file and
cognizance of the offence was taken, in this case, separate petition to
condone the delay of 1211 days is not necessary and M/s. Dakshin
Granites Private Ltd. was impleaded as an Accused. Admittedly,
statutory notice Under Section 138(b) of the Negotiable Instruments
Act was issued to M/s. Dakshin Granites Private Ltd., and M/s. Dakshin
Granites Private Ltd., has not preferred any revision before this Court.
Hence, the present Petitioner is only the signatory. Even according to
the present Petitioner, who is an individual person and who signed the
cheque represents the company.
The High Court, concluded that as no revision is filed by DAKSHIN the ""revision
preferred by the Petitioner is not maintainable. No merits in the petition.""
17. We are of the opinion that it is difficult to understand the conclusions recorded by
both the courts below. They are wholly illogical, to use a very mild expression.
18. Section 142 of THE ACT inter alia stipulates that no court shall take cognizance of
any offence punishable Under Section 138 unless a complaint is made within one month
of the date on which the cause of action arises under Clause (c) of the proviso to
Section 138. The relevant portion of Section 142 reads as follows:
142 Cognizance of offences. -Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973-
(a) no court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable Under
Section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or,
as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque;
(b) such complaint is made within one month of the date on which the
cause of action arises under Clause (c) of the proviso to Section 138:
Provided that the cognizance of a complaint may be taken by the Court
after the prescribed period, if the complainant satisfies the Court that
he had sufficient cause for not making a complaint within such period.
19. The preliminary facts constituting an offence5 Under Section 138 of the Act are; (i)
that a cheque is drawn, and (ii) that cheque is dishonored by the Bank when presented
by the payee. Under the scheme of Section 138 both the drawer of the cheque and the
bank upon which the cheque is drawn are parties against whom the payee of the cheque
can have various legal rights, which may have either civil or criminal consequences or
perhaps both depending upon the facts of a given case. Section 138 prescribes only one
of the consequences, i.e. the prosecution and punishment of only the drawer of the
cheque. It is possible in a given case that a bank may without any valid justification
decline to honor a cheque drawn on it. For which act of the bank, the drawer of the
cheque may in no way be responsible either in fact or in law. In such a fact situation,
the payee of the cheque may have legal rights and remedies for the redressal of the
injury (if any) caused by the Bank in addition to his rights against the drawer of the
cheque.
20. The offence Under Section 138 of THE ACT is capable of being committed only by
the drawer of the cheque. The logic of the High Court that since the offence is already
taken cognizance of, there is no need to take cognizance of the offence against
DAKSHIN is flawed. Section 141 stipulates the liability for the offence punishable Under
Section 138 of THE ACT when the person committing such an offence happens to be a
company-in other words when the drawer of the cheque happens to be a company.
Relevant portion of Section 141 reads as follows:
Section 141. Offences by companies.-
(1) If the person committing an offence Under Section 138 is a
company, every person who, at the time the offence was committed,
was in charge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct
of the business of the company, as well as the company, shall be
deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded
against and punished accordingly:
21. This Court in Aneeta Hada, had an occasion to examine the question ""whether an
authorised signatory of a company would be liable for prosecution Under Section 138 of
the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for brevity ""the Act"") without the company being
arraigned as an Accused"" and held as follows:
59. In view of our aforesaid analysis, we arrive at the irresistible conclusion
that for maintaining the prosecution Under Section 141 of the Act, arraigning of
a company as an Accused is imperative. The other categories of offenders can
only be brought in the drag-net on the touchstone of vicarious liability as the
same has been stipulated in the provision itself. ...
Yet the High Court reached a conclusion that the revision filed by the Petitioner is not
maintainable because DAKSHIN did not choose to challenge the trial court's order.
The High Court failed to appreciate that the liability of the Appellant (if any in the
context of the facts of the present case) is only statutory because of his legal status as
the DIRECTOR of DAKSHIN. Every person signing a cheque on behalf of a company on
whose account a cheque is drawn does not become the drawer of the cheque. Such a
signatory is only a person duly authorised to sign the cheque on behalf of the
company/drawer of the cheque. If DAKSHIN/drawer of the cheque is sought to be
summoned for being tried for an offence Under Section 138 of THE ACT beyond the
period of limitation prescribed under THE ACT, the Appellant cannot be told in view of
the law declared by this Court in Aneeta Hada that he can make no grievance of that
fact on the ground that DAKSHIN did not make any grievance of such summoning. It is
always open to DAKSHIN to raise the defense that the initiation of prosecution against it
is barred by limitation. DAKSHIN need not necessarily challenge the summoning order.
It can raise such a defense in the course of trial.
Coming to the view of the High Court that only the offence is taken cognizance of and
there is no need to take cognizance of an offence Accused-wise is an erroneous view in
the context of a prosecution under THE ACT. Most probably the High Court recorded
such conclusion (though not expressly stated) on the basis of the judgment of this
Court in Raghubans Dubey v. State of Bihar MANU/SC/0074/1967 : AIR 1967 SC
1167, where it was stated:
Para 9. ... In our opinion, once cognizance has been taken by the Magistrate, he
takes cognizance of an offence and not the offenders; once he takes cognizance
of an offence it is his duty to find out who the offenders really are and once he
comes to the conclusion that apart from the persons sent up by the police some
other persons are involved, it is his duty to proceed against those persons. ...
Such a statement of law was made by this Court in the background of the scheme of the
Code of Criminal Procedure.
22. The Code of Criminal Procedure is an enactment which is designed to regulate the
procedures governing the investigation of crimes in order to get the perpetrators of the
crime punished. A crime is an act or omission prohibited by law attracting certain legal
consequences like imprisonment, fine etc. Obviously, acts or omissions constituting
offences/crimes are capable of being committed only by persons either natural or
juridical.
The Code of Criminal Procedure imposes a duty on the investigating agencies to gather
evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a crime and to trace out the
perpetrators of the crime in order to get them punished. Punishment can be inflicted
only by a competent Court but not by the investigating agency. Courts are authorised to
inflict punishment if only they are satisfied that the evidence gathered by the
investigating agency is sufficient to establish that (1) a crime had been committed; and
(2) the persons charged with the offence (Accused) and brought before the Court by the
investigating agency for trial are the perpetrators of the crime.
Under the Scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure, any investigating agency
(normally the police) is bound to investigate by following the procedure prescribed
therein once it receives either information regarding the commission of a cognizable
offence or an order from a Magistrate to investigate into the allegation of the occurrence
of a non-cognizable offence and submit a report Under Section 173. Section 173(2)(i)
(d) inter alia stipulates that the report should contain a statement:
Whether any offence appears to have been committed and if so by whom?
The conclusions reached by the police after investigation into the above two questions
are required to be scrutinized by a competent Court. It is only after the Court is satisfied
that the evidence collected by the investigating agency is sufficient in law to punish the
Accused, such Accused can be punished. Taking cognizance of an offence by the Court
is one of the initial steps in the process. Thereafter, the investigating agency is required
to collect evidence (investigate) and place the same before the Court Under Section 173
Code of Criminal Procedure.
2 3 . The scheme of the prosecution in punishing Under Section 138 of THE ACT is
different from the scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 138 creates an
offence and prescribes punishment. No procedure for the investigation of the offence is
contemplated. The prosecution is initiated on the basis of a written complaint made by
the payee of a cheque. Obviously such complaints must contain the factual allegations
constituting each of the ingredients of the offence Under Section 138. Those ingredients
are: (1) that a person drew a cheque on an account maintained by him with the banker;
(2) that such a cheque when presented to the bank is returned by the bank unpaid; (3)
that such a cheque was presented to the bank within a period of six months from the
date it was drawn or within the period of its validity whichever is earlier; (4) that the
payee demanded in writing from the drawer of the cheque the payment of the amount of
money due under the cheque to payee; and (5) such a notice of payment is made within
a period of 30 days from the date of the receipt of the information by the payee from
the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid. It is obvious from the scheme of
Section 138 that each one of the ingredients flows from a document which evidences
the existence of such an ingredient. The only other ingredient which is required to be
proved to establish the commission of an offence Under Section 138 is that inspite of
the demand notice referred to above, the drawer of the cheque failed to make the
payment within a period of 15 days from the date of the receipt of the demand. A fact
which the complainant can only assert but not prove, the burden would essentially be
on the drawer of the cheque to prove that he had in fact made the payment pursuant to
the demand.
24. By the nature of the offence Under Section 138 of THE ACT, the first ingredient
constituting the offence is the fact that a person drew a cheque. The identity of the
drawer of the cheque is necessarily required to be known to the complainant (payee)
and needs investigation and would not normally be in dispute unless the person who is
alleged to have drawn a cheque disputes that very fact. The other facts required to be
proved for securing the punishment of the person who drew a cheque that eventually
got dishonoured is that the payee of the cheque did in fact comply with each one of the
steps contemplated Under Section 138 of THE ACT before initiating prosecution.
Because it is already held by this Court that failure to comply with any one of the steps
contemplated Under Section 138 would not provide ""cause of action for prosecution"".
Therefore, in the context of a prosecution Under Section 138, the concept of taking
cognizance of the offence but not the offender is not appropriate. Unless the complaint
contains all the necessary factual allegations constituting each of the ingredients of the
offence Under Section 138, the Court cannot take cognizance of the offence. Disclosure
of the name of the person drawing the cheque is one of the factual allegations which a
complaint is required to contain. Otherwise in the absence of any authority of law to
investigate the offence Under Section 138, there would be no person against whom a
Court can proceed. There cannot be a prosecution without an Accused. The offence
Under Section 138 is person specific. Therefore, the Parliament declared Under Section
142 that the provisions dealing with taking cognizance contained in the Code of
Criminal Procedure should give way to the procedure prescribed Under Section 142.
Hence the opening of non-obstante Clause Under Section 142. It must also be
remembered that Section 142 does not either contemplate a report to the police or
authorise the Court taking cognizance to direct the police to investigate into the
complaint.
2 5 . The question whether the Respondent had sufficient cause for not filing the
complaint against DAKSHIN within the period prescribed under THE ACT is not
examined by either of the courts below. As rightly pointed out, the application, which is
the subject matter of the instant appeal purportedly filed invoking Section 319 Code of
Criminal Procedure, is only a device by which the Respondent seeks to initiate
prosecution against DAKSHIN beyond the period of limitation stipulated under the Act.
26. No doubt Section 142 authorises the Court to condone the delay in appropriate
cases. We find no reason to condone the delay. The justification advanced by the
Respondent that it is during the course of the trial, the Respondent realized that the
cheque in question was drawn on the account of DAKSHIN is a manifestly false
statement. On the face of the cheque, it is clear that it was drawn on account of
DAKSHIN. Admittedly the Respondent issued a notice contemplated under Clause (b) of
the proviso to Section 138 to DAKSHIN. The fact is recorded by the High Court. The
relevant portion is already extracted in para 16.
27. The judgment under appeal is contrary to the language of THE ACT as expounded
by this Court in Aneeta Hada (supra) and, therefore, cannot be sustained. The
judgment is, accordingly, set aside. The appeal is allowed. In the circumstances, the
costs is quantified at Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Only).","Appellants: N. Harihara Krishnan

Facts:
Respondent filed complaint against Appellant under Section 138 of the Act for
dishonouring of cheque on the ground that the account on which the cheque
was drawn had been closed. The cheque in question was drawn on the
account of Appellant company and the Appellant was only a signatory as a
Director of Appellant company. The Trial Court allowed the application of
Respondent. The Trial Court concluded that since the case was already taken
on file and cognizance of the offence was taken separate petition to condone
the delay was not necessary and Appellant company was impleaded as an
accused. Appellant who was an individual person and who signed the cheque
represents the company. The High Court concluded that no revision was filed
by Appellant company and the revision preferred by the Appellant was not
maintainable. Hence present appeal by Appellant.
Held, while allowing the appeal:
(i) The logic of the High Court that since the offence was already taken
cognizance of, there was no need to take cognizance of the offence against
Appellant company was flawed. The High Court failed to appreciate that the
liability of the Appellant was only statutory because of his legal status as the
director of Appellant company. Every person signing a cheque on behalf of a
company on whose account a cheque was drawn did not become the drawer
of the cheque. Such a signatory was only a person duly authorised to sign the
cheque on behalf of the company of the cheque. If drawer of the cheque was
sought to be summoned for being tried for an offence under Section 138 of
Act beyond the period of limitation the Appellant could not be told that he
could make no grievance of that fact on the ground that Appellant company
did not make any grievance of such summoning. It was always open to
Appellant company to raise the defense that the initiation of prosecution
against it was barred by limitation. The view of the High Court that only the
offence was taken cognizance of and there was no need to take cognizance of
an offence Appellant-wise was an erroneous view in the context of a
prosecution under the Act. [21]
(ii) The scheme of the prosecution in punishing under Section 138 of the Act

1. Leave granted.
Prologue:
2. Borrowers want to see the colour of their money in haste. The problem arises when
loans have to be repaid. All kinds of techniques were and are deployed, to prolong the
legal endeavours to recover the debts by lending institutions. Thus, the procedure
became cumbersome and time consuming, affecting the lending activity.
3 . An endeavour towards banking sector reforms, was the setting up of Expert
Committees known as The Andhyarujina Committee', and The Narasimham Committee I
and II'. To facilitate the disposal of the claims of recovery made by various banks and
financial institutions, the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act,
1993 (hereinafter referred to as the 'RDDB Act') was enacted, providing for specialized
tribunals, exclusively dealing with the jurisdiction of the civil courts. This was followed
up by the implementation of the suggestions of the aforesaid two Committees, for
bringing in a law empowering financial institutions to take possession of the securities
and to sell the same without the intervention of the Court-thus the Securitisation and
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002
(hereinafter referred to as the 'SARFAESI Act').
4 . The 'Statement of Objects and Reasons' for bringing in the SARFAESI Act, itself
shows that the absence of legal provisions for facilitating securitisation of financial
assets of banks and financial institutions was the reason for its enactment. The legal
framework relating to commercial transactions had not kept pace with the changing
commercial practices and financial sector reforms. The slow pace of recovery of
defaulting loans and the mounting levels of non-performing assets of banks and
financial institutions had resulted in the setting up of the aforesaid two Committees.
5. It need be emphasized that any impetus to the industrial development of the country
by encouraging banks and other financial institutions to formulate a liberal policy for
grant of loans had to be necessarily coupled with a quick and efficacious recovery
process. The background and salient features of the SARFAESI Act have been
extensively analysed by this Court in Mardia Chemicals Ltd. and Ors. v. Union of
India and Ors. MANU/SC/0323/2004 : (2004) 4 SCC 311 and inU nited Bank of
India v. Satyawati Tondon MANU/SC/0541/2010 : (2010) 8 SCC 110.
The Facts:
6 . The Appellants borrowed monies for their business against security of immovable
properties by the creation of an equitable mortgage by deposit of title documents
(seven such properties) on 30.09.2015 and 21.10.2015. The financial discipline was not
adhered to, apparently almost from the inception, and the account of the Appellants
became a 'Non-Performing Asset' ('NPA') within the meaning of Section 2(1)(o) of the
SARFAESI Act on 6.7.2016 itself.
7 . The agreement inter se the parties contained an arbitration Clause and thus, the
matter went to arbitration on the lender/Respondent invoking the arbitration Clause on
16.11.2016. However, prior to this invocation, a notification was issued on 05.08.2016
in exercise of powers conferred under Sub-clause (iv) of Clause (m) of Sub-section (1)
of Section 2 read with Section 31A of the SARFAESI Act, specifying certain 'Non-
Banking Financial Companies' (hereinafter referred to as 'NBFC') covered under Clause
(f) of Section 45-1 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (hereinafter referred to as the
'RBI Act'), having assets of Rs. 500 crore and above, as financial institutions and
directing that, in public interest, the provisions of the SARFAESI Act shall apply to such
financial institutions, with the exceptions of provisions of Sections 13 to 19, which shall
apply only to such security interest which is obtained for securing repayment of secured
debt with principal amount of Rs. 1 crore and above. The Respondent is at serial No. 68
of the said notification.
8 . In view of the aforesaid notification, the Respondent issued a notice Under Section
13(2) of the SARFAESI Act on 24.11.2016 for one of the seven properties. The
statement of claim was filed by the Respondent before the Arbitrator on 14.12.2016 and
interim orders were granted by the Arbitrator on 05.01.2017 restraining the Appellant
from creating any third party interest over the properties. On 16.02.2017, the
Respondent issued another notice Under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act for two
more of the seven properties.
9. Insofar as the arbitration proceedings are concerned, the interim order of 05.01.2017
was confirmed on 03.03.2017. In order to remove any possible impediment in the
SARFAESI proceedings, an application was filed by the Respondent to substitute the
order of status quo qua parties with the name of the Appellants/borrowers, which was
allowed on 19.05.2017.
10. The Appellants, aggrieved by this order, filed an appeal Under Section 37(2)(b) of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the Arbitration
Act'), which has been dismissed by the impugned order dated 13.07.2017 of the learned
Single Judge of the Delhi High Court.
Legal Issues:
11. A perusal of the impugned order and the submissions made by learned Counsel for
the parties have thrown up the following legal issues for determination:
A. Whether the arbitration proceedings initiated by the Respondent can be
carried on along with the SARFAESI proceedings simultaneously?
B. Whether resort can be had to Section 13 of the SARFAESI Act in respect of debts
which have arisen out of a loan agreement/mortgage created prior to the application of
the SARFAESI Act to the Respondent?
C. A linked question to question (ii), whether the lender can invoke the SARFAESI Act
provision where its notification as financial institution Under Section 2(1)(m) has been
issued after the account became an NPA Under Section 2(1)(o) of the said Act?
Appellants' case:
12. The Appellants appearing through Mr. Guru Krishna Kumar, Senior Advocate sought
to contend that Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act was a substantive provision and
imposed a new burden affecting an existing obligation, thus repelling the plea of the
Respondent that the said provision was only procedural in nature. The security interest
was capable of being enforced under the SARFAESI Act without the intervention of the
court or the tribunal, and this right was available notwithstanding any provisions
contained in Sections 69 & 69A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 [Section 13(1)
containing the notwithstanding provision]. It was thus pleaded that it was impermissible
to take recourse to the provisions of the SARFAESI Act in respect of an account already
declared an NPA, as that would amount to retrospective application of a substantive law.
The Appellants sought to dispute the plea of the absence of any new obligation or
additional burden as advanced by the Respondent, since the debts had to be repaid
within 60 days from the date of issuing the notice Under Section 13 of the SARFAESI
Act.
13. The Appellants also pleaded that the expression ""retrospective"" and ""retroactive""
are almost synonymous and in that behalf referred to the definition of these expressions
as found in the 'Black's Law Dictionary' and Wharton's Law Lexicon' treating the
provisions as synonymous. A reference was also made to the judgment in State Bank's
Staff Union (Madras Circle) v. Union of India and Ors. MANU/SC/0564/2005 :
(2005) 7 SCC 584 and D.S. Nakara v. Union of India MANU/SC/0237/1982 : (1983)
1 SCC 305 to advance a proposition that the statute could have only prospective
application, unless it states in clear terms, to be expressly retrospective.
14. The Appellants referred to a catena of judgments for the legal proposition that a
statute which effects substantive rights is presumed to be prospective in operation
unless made retrospective and the basis of the same is the principle of 'fairness'-(Zile
Singh v. State of Haryana MANU/SC/0876/2004 : (2004) 8 SCC 1;G ovind Das v.
ITO MANU/SC/0248/1975 : (1976) 1 SCC 906;C IT v. Vatika Township (P) Ltd.
MANU/SC/0810/2014 : (2015) 1 SCC 1; Shyam Sundar and Ors. v. Ram Kumar and
Ors. MANU/SC/0405/2001 : (2001) 8 SCC 24;G arikapatti Veeraya v. N. Subbayah
Chowdhary MANU/SC/0008/1957 : (1957) SCR 488;H itendra Vishnu Thakur v.
State of Maharashtra MANU/SC/0526/1994 : (1994) 4 SCC 602.)
15. The reason why the Appellants claimed that it was a case of substantive law, and
not procedural law, is that more stringent provisions in terms of the entitlement of
debtors to liquidate a secured asset, without the intervention of the Court, are brought
into force.
1 6 . Another plea which was sought to be advanced is that the NBFCs stand on a
different footing, and that it is not as if ipso facto, all NBFCs are included within the
ambit of the Act, but only such of the NBFCs as are notified by the Central Government.
Further, it was stated that the RDDB Act does not include in its term the NBFC. These
factors were stated to be material to exclude the security interest created prior to the
application of the Act.
17. On the first legal issue referred to aforesaid, it has been contended that a notice
seeking arbitration was issued first, and that too after the provisions of the SARFAESI
Act had been made applicable to the Respondent and thus, the Respondent had elected
its remedy by seeking recovery through the arbitration process and, therefore, could not
subsequently and simultaneously initiate proceedings under the SARFAESI Act.
Respondent's case:
18. On behalf of the Respondent, Mr. C.A. Sundaram, Senior Advocate contended that
the effect of notifying the Respondent as an NBFC to which the SARFAESI Act applies,
would imply that the provisions of the said Act can be used to take recourse to any live
and actionable debt, i.e., a debt in praesenti. In order to invoke the provision, it was
submitted, four factors are of significance:
i. Existence of a present actionable debt;
ii. Status of the person invoking the jurisdiction is that of a secured creditor;
iii. Assets have been secured in satisfaction of the debt; and
iv. That the debtor/borrower should have been declared an NPA.
1 9 . Learned senior Counsel contended that the Act itself was brought into force to
eliminate the problem of recovery of the debts by means of the sale of security interest
and thus, obviously applied to all the past debts which were still due and pending. The
only difference was that qua the Respondent, it came into force when the notification
was issued. It was stated that a contrary interpretation, if taken to the logical
conclusion, would imply that when the Act was brought into force, none of the existing
security interests would be affected, thereby defeating the very objective of the
SARFAESI Act.
20. It was further submitted that insofar as the Respondent is concerned, a common
notification dated 05.08.2016 specifies the financial parameters in respect of which, the
said Act would apply. Those parameters are met in the present case and there is no
differentiation in the enforcement mechanism contained in Section 13 of the said Act
between a bank and an NBFC, as both these institutions are similarly placed.
21. It was contended that the SARFAESI Act did not create any new obligation on the
Appellants, who are the borrowers required to repay debts secured by mortgaged
properties, but only provides a procedure, without the intervention of the Courts to
enforce the rights which have already accrued to the lender, by virtue of having lent
monies. It is only a new remedy in terms of the manner of such recovery. The
legislation itself is procedural in nature.
22. On the issue of simultaneous proceedings for recovery under the arbitration process
and the SARFAESI Act it was contended that there is no prohibition in law from doing
so. The process of recovery could have taken place in a civil suit prior to the enactment
of the RDDB Act which provides for a specialized forum for recovery of dues. It is
settled legal position that both the RDDB Act and the SARFAESI Act can be resorted to
simultaneously and thus the arbitration proceedings are only an alternative to the RDDB
Act. Section 37 of the SARFAESI Act, in fact, makes it clear that the provisions of the
Act are in addition to and are not in derogation of any other law for the time being in
force.
Cleavage of judicial opinions:
23. The opinions of various High Courts, as cited before us, show that while the Full
Bench of the Orissa High Court, as also the Delhi High Court and the Allahabad High
Court have taken a view favourable to the Respondent in terms of the simultaneous
legal processes under the SARFAESI Act and arbitration recovery proceedings, the
Andhra Pradesh High Court has taken a divergent view.
Conclusion:
24. We have examined the rival contentions and the judicial precedents cited before us.
The impugned order is a well-reasoned order giving cogent reasons, but what
persuaded us to grant leave and hear the matter finally, was this cleavage of judicial
opinions inter se the High Courts, requiring this Court to settle the law on the point.
25. We now proceed to examine each of the three questions of law framed:
Question A:
26. A claim by a bank or a financial institution, before the specified laws came into
force, would ordinarily have been filed in the Civil Court having the pecuniary
jurisdiction. The setting up of the Debt Recovery Tribunal under the RDDB Act resulted
in this specialised Tribunal entertaining such claims by the banks and financial
institutions, In fact, suits from the civil jurisdiction were transferred to the Debt
Recovery Tribunal. The Tribunal was, thus, an alternative to a Civil Court recovery
proceedings.
27. On the SARFAESI Act being brought into force seeking to recover debts against
security interest, a question was raised whether parallel proceedings could go on under
the RDDB Act and the SARFAESI Act. This issue was clearly answered in favour of such
simultaneous proceedings in Transcore v. Union of India and Anr.
MANU/SC/5319/2006 : (2008) 1 SCC 125. A later judgment inM athew Varghese v.
M. Amritha Kumar MANU/SC/0114/2014 : (2014) 5 SCC 610 also discussed this issue
in the following terms:
45. A close reading of Section 37 shows that the provisions of the SARFAESI
Act or the Rules framed thereunder will be in addition to the provisions of the
RDDB Act. Section 35 of the SARFAESI Act states that the provisions of the
SARFAESI Act will have overriding effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent
contained in any other law for the time being in force. Therefore, reading
Sections 35 and 37 together, it will have to be held that in the event of any of
the provisions of the RDDB Act not being inconsistent with the provisions of the
SARFAESI Act, the application of both the Acts, namely, the SARFAESI Act and
the RDDB Act, would be complementary to each other. In this context, reliance
can be placed upon the decision in Transcore v. Union of India
[MANU/SC/5319/2006 : (2008) 1 SCC 125: (2008) 1 SCC (Civ) 116]. In para
64 it is stated as under after referring to Section 37 of the SARFAESI Act: (SCC
p. 162)
""64.... According to American Jurisprudence, 2d, Vol. 25, p. 652, if in
truth there is only one remedy, then the doctrine of election does not
apply. In the present case, as stated above, the NPA Act is an additional
remedy to the DRT Act. Together they constitute one remedy and,
therefore, the doctrine of election does not apply. Even according to
Snell's Principles of Equity (31st Edn., p. 119), the doctrine of election
of remedies is applicable only when there are two or more co-existent
remedies available to the litigants at the time of election which are
repugnant and inconsistent. In any event, there is no repugnancy nor
inconsistency between the two remedies, therefore, the doctrine of
election has no application.""
46. A reading of Section 37 discloses that the application of the SARFAESI Act
will be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of the RDDB Act.
In other words, it will not in any way nullify or annul or impair the effect of the
provisions of the RDDB Act. We are also fortified by our above statement of law
as the heading of the said Section also makes the position clear that application
of other laws are not barred. The effect of Section 37 would, therefore, be that
in addition to the provisions contained under the SARFAESI Act, in respect of
proceedings initiated under the said Act, it will be in order for a party to fall
back upon the provisions of the other Acts mentioned in Section 37, namely,
the Companies Act, 1956, the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, the
Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, the Recovery of Debts Due to
Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, or any other law for the time being
in force.
28. These observations, thus, leave no manner of doubt and the issue is no more res
integra, especially keeping in mind the provisions of Sections 35 and 37 of the
SARFAESI Act, which read as under:
35. The provisions of this Act to override other laws.-The provisions of
this Act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith
contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having
effect by virtue of any such law.
................
37. Application of other laws not barred.-The provisions of this
Act or the Rules made thereunder shall be in addition to, and not in
derogation of, the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), the Securities
Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956), the Securities and
Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992), the Recovery of Debts
Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (51 of 1993) or any
other law for the time being in force.
29. The aforesaid two Acts are, thus, complimentary to each other and it is not a case
of election of remedy.
30. The only twist in the present case is that, instead of the recovery process under the
RDDB Act, we are concerned with an arbitration proceeding. It is trite to say that
arbitration is an alternative to the civil proceedings. In fact, when a question was raised
as to whether the matters which came within the scope and jurisdiction of the Debt
Recovery Tribunal under the RDDB Act, could still be referred to arbitration when both
parties have incorporated such a clause, the answer was given in the affirmative1. That
being the position, the Appellants can hardly be permitted to contend that the initiation
of arbitration proceedings would, in any manner, prejudice their rights to seek relief
under the SARFAESI Act.
31. The discussion in the impugned order refers to a judgment of the Full Bench of the
Delhi High Court in HDFC Bank Limited v. Satpal Singh Baksh i2013(134)DRJ 566
(FB) opining that an arbitration is an alternative to the RDDB Act. In that context, the
learned Single Judge has rightly held that this Full Bench judgment does not, in any
manner, help the Appellants but, in fact, supports the case of the Respondent. The
jurisdiction of the Civil Court is barred for matters covered by the RDDB Act, but the
parties still have freedom to choose a forum, alternate to, and in place of the regular
courts or judicial system for deciding their inter se disputes. All disputes relating to the
""right in personam"" are arbitrable and, therefore, the choice is given to the parties to
choose this alternative forum. A claim of money by a bank or a financial institution
cannot be treated as a ""right in rem"", which has an inherent public interest and would
thus not be arbitrable.
32. The aforesaid is not a case of election of remedies as was sought to be canvassed
by learned senior Counsel for the Appellants, since the alternatives are between a Civil
Court, Arbitral Tribunal or a Debt Recovery Tribunal constituted under the RDDB Act.
Insofar as that election is concerned, the mode of settlement of disputes to an arbitral
tribunal has been elected. The provisions of the SARFAESI Act are thus, a remedy in
addition to the provisions of the Arbitration Act. In Transcore v. Union of India and
Anr. (supra) it was clearly observed that the SARFAESI Act was enacted to regulate
securitisation and reconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of security interest
and for matters connected therewith. Liquidation of secured interest through a more
expeditious procedure is what has been envisaged under the SARFAESI Act and the two
Acts are cumulative remedies to the secured creditors.
3 3 . SARFAESI proceedings are in the nature of enforcement proceedings, while
arbitration is an adjudicatory process. In the event that the secured assets are
insufficient to satisfy the debts, the secured creditor can proceed against other assets in
execution against the debtor, after determination of the pending outstanding amount by
a competent forum.
34. We are, thus, unequivocally of the view that the judgments of the Full Bench of the
Orissa High Court in Sarthak Builders Pvt. Ltd. v. Orissa Rural Development
Corporation Limited MANU/OR/0110/2014, the Full Bench of the Delhi High Court in
HDFC Bank Limited v. Satpal Singh Bakshi (supra) and the Division Bench of the
Allahabad High Court in Pradeep Kumar Gupta v. State of U.P. MANU/UP/0209/2009
: AIR 2010 All 3 lay down the correct proposition of law and the view expressed by the
Andhra Pradesh High Court in M/s. Deccan Chronicles Holdings Limited v. Union
of India MANU/AP/0060/2014 : AIR 2014 Andhra Pradesh 78 following the overruled
decision of the Orissa High Court in Subash Chandra Panda v. State of Orissa
MANU/OR/0069/2008 : AIR 2008 Ori 88 does not set forth the correct position in law.
SARFAESI proceedings and arbitration proceedings, thus, can go hand in hand.
Questions B & C
3 5 . The issue of whether resort can be had to Section 13 of the SARFAESI Act in
respect of debts which have arisen out of a loan, agreement/mortgage created prior to
the application of the SARFAESI Act to the Respondent, though urged before us,
appears really not to have been canvassed before the learned Single Judge of the Delhi
High Court. At least, it finds no substantive mention. We, however, are of the view that
in the larger interest of settling the question of law, this issue is also required to be
dealt with.
36. The SARFAESI Act was brought into force to solve the problem of recovery of large
debts in NPAs. Thus, the very rationale for the said Act to be brought into force was to
provide an expeditious procedure where there was a security interest. It certainly did
not apply retrospectively from the date when it came into force. The question is
whether, the Act being applicable to the Respondent at a subsequent date and thereby
allowing the Respondent to utilize its provisions with regards to a past debt, would
make any difference to this principle. We are of the view that the answer to the same is
in the negative.
37. The Act applies to all the claims which would be alive at the time when it was
brought into force. Thus, qua the Respondent or other NBFCs, it would be applicable
similarly from the date when it was so made applicable to them.
38. The Full Bench of the Orissa High Court in Sarthak Builders Pvt. Ltd. v. Orissa
Rural Development Corporation Limited (supra) has, in fact, succinctly sets out
this aspect. No doubt, till the Respondent was not a 'financial institution' within the
meaning of Section 2(1)(m)(iv) of the SARFAESI Act, it was not a 'secured creditor' as
defined Under Section 2(1)(zd) of the SARFAESI Act and, thus, could not invoke the
provisions of the SARFAESI Act. However, the right to proceed under the SARFAESI Act
accrued once the Notification was issued. The Full Bench referred to a Division Bench
judgment of the Uttarakhand High Court in Unique Engineering Works v. Union of
India MANU/UC/0018/2003 : II (2004) BC 241 (DB) which dealt with the issue of
retrospectivity and retroactivity. In case of retroactivity, the Parliament takes note of the
existing conditions and promulgates the remedial measures to rectify those conditions.
In fact the SARFAESI Act, in our view, was to remedy such a position and provide a
measure against secured interests. The scheme of the SARFAESI Act, is really to provide
a procedural remedy against security interest already created. Therefore, an existing
borrower, who had been granted financial assistance was covered Under Section 2(f) of
the said Act as a 'borrower'. Not only this expression, the definition clauses dealing with
'debt securities', 'financial assistance', 'financial assets', etc., clearly convey the
legislative intent that the SARFAESI Act applies to all existing agreements irrespective of
the fact whether the lender was a notified 'financial institution' on the date of the
execution of the agreement with the borrower or not. The scheme of the SARFAESI Act
sets out an expeditious, procedural methodology, enabling the bank to take possession
of the property for non-payment of dues, without intervention of the court. The mere
fact that a more expeditious remedy is provided under the SARFAESI Act does not mean
that it is substantive in character or has created an altogether new right. To accept the
argument of the Appellants would imply that they have an inherent right to delay the
enforcement against the security interest!
39. The catena of judgments referred to by learned senior Counsel for the Appellants on
substantive law not being retrospective in operation, unless expressly stated so in the
Act would, thus, have no application to the matter in issue, in view of what we have
observed aforesaid. On the other hand, as observed by Buckley, L.J. in West v.
Gwynne 1911 2 Ch 1 at pp. 11, 12, retrospective operation is one matter and
interference with existing rights is another. In that context, it was ruled that the
provisions of the Conveyancing of Law and Property Act, 1892 were held applicable to
leases containing a covenant, condition or agreement against assigning, under-letting or
parting with possession or disposing of land or property leased without license or
consent to all leases whether executed before or after the commencement of the Act.
Such a construction was held not to make the Act retrospective in operation but merely
effected the future existing rights under all leases whether executed before or after the
date of that Act. (Discussed in Trimbak Damodhar Raipurkar v. Assaram Hiraman
Patil and Ors. MANU/SC/0344/1961 : 1962 Supp(I) SCR 700).
40. In a similar vein, are the observations made in the case of In re Athlumney. Ex
parte Wilson [1898] 2 Q.B. 547, where the question posed before the Queen's
Division Bench was whether Section 23 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1890 was retrospective
in its operation. In the aforementioned context, Wright, J., speaking for the Bench,
illuminatingly opined:
Perhaps no Rule of construction is more firmly established than this--that a
retrospective operation is not to be given to a statute so as to impair an
existing right or obligation, otherwise than as regards matter of procedure,
unless that effect cannot be avoided without doing violence to the language of
the enactment. If the enactment is expressed in language which is fairly capable
of either interpretation, it ought to be construed as prospective only... it is a
general Rule that when the Legislature alters the rights of parties by taking
away or conferring any right of action, its enactments, unless in express terms
they apply to pending actions, do not affect them...It is said that there is one
exception to that rule, namely, that, where enactments merely affect procedure
and do not extend to rights of action, they have been held to apply to existing
rights, and it is suggested here that the alteration made by this Section is within
that exception...
41. Similarly, the date on which a debt is declared as an NPA would again have no
impact. We are, thus, of the view that the provisions of the SARFAESI Act would
become applicable qua all debts owing and live when the Act became applicable to the
Respondent in terms of the parameters contended by learned senior Counsel for the
Respondent and enlisted at serial Nos. i to iv in para 18.
42. We are, thus, of the view that the appeal is completely devoid of merit, and is only
an endeavour to prolong the ultimate ""date of judgment"" for the Appellants to meet
their obligations.
43. The appeal is dismissed with costs quantified at Rs. 20,000/-.","Appellants: M.D. Frozen Foods Exports Pvt. Ltd. and Ors.

ARBITRATION MATTERS - SLPS CHALLENGING ARBITRATION MATTERS
Facts:
The Appellants borrowed monies for their business against security of
immovable properties by the creation of an equitable mortgage by deposit of
title documents (seven such properties). The financial discipline was not
adhered to, apparently almost from the inception, and the account of the
Appellants became a 'Non-Performing Asset' ('NPA') within the meaning of
Section 2(1)(o) of the SARFAESI Act. The agreement inter se the parties
contained an arbitration Clause and thus, the matter went to arbitration on
the lender/Respondent invoking the arbitration Clause. The Respondent
issued a notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act for one of the seven
properties. The statement of claim was filed by the Respondent before the
Arbitrator and interim orders were granted by the Arbitrator restraining the
Appellant from creating any third party interest over the properties. The
Respondent issued another notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act
for two more of the seven properties. Insofar as the arbitration proceedings
were concerned, the interim order was confirmed. In order to remove any
possible impediment in the SARFAESI proceedings, an application was filed by
the Respondent to substitute the order of status quo qua parties with the
name of the Appellants/borrowers, which was allowed. The Appellants,
aggrieved by this order, filed an appeal which had been dismissed by the
impugned order of the High Court. Hence, present appeal.
Held, while dismissing the appeal:
(i) It was trite to say that arbitration was an alternative to the civil
proceedings. In fact, when a question was raised as to whether the matters
which came within the scope and jurisdiction of the Debt Recovery Tribunal
under the RDDB Act, could still be referred to arbitration when both parties
have incorporated such a clause, the answer was given in the affirmative.
That being the position, the Appellants can hardly be permitted to contend
that the initiation of arbitration proceedings would, in any manner, prejudice
their rights to seek relief under the SARFAESI Act. SARFAESI proceedings
were in the nature of enforcement proceedings, while arbitration was an
adjudicatory process. In the event that the secured assets were insufficient to
satisfy the debts, the secured creditor could proceed against other assets in
execution against the debtor, after determination of the pending outstanding
amount by a competent forum. [30] and[33]
(ii) The SARFAESI Act was brought into force to solve the problem of recovery
of large debts in NPAs. Thus, the very rationale for the said Act to be brought
into force was to provide an expeditious procedure where there was a security
interest. It certainly did not apply retrospectively from the date when it came
into force. The question is whether, the Act being applicable to the
Respondent at a subsequent date and thereby allowing the Respondent to
utilize its provisions with regards to a past debt, would make any difference
to this principle. [36]
(iii) Similarly, the date on which a debt was declared as an NPA would again
have no impact. The provisions of the SARFAESI Act would become applicable
qua all debts owing and live when the Act became applicable to the
Respondent. [41]",,,,
"Anil R. Dave, J.
1. While considering Civil Appeal No. D 35086 of 2013, this Court expressed its doubt
in relation to the period of limitation for filing the written statement or giving version of
the opponent as per the provisions of Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act,
1986 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'). The question was, whether the said issue was
governed by the law laid down by this Court in Dr. J.J. Merchant and Ors. v.
Shrinath Chaturvedi [MANU/SC/0668/2002 : (2002) 6 SCC 635] orK ailash v.
Nanhku and Ors. [MANU/SC/0264/2005 : (2005) 4 SCC 480]. The following order
was passed by this Court in the aforestated Civil Appeal on 29th November, 2013:
1. Heard Mr. Vahanvati, learned Attorney General, in support of these appeals.
Mr. Guru Krishna Kumar, learned senior Counsel, appears for the
Respondent(s).
2. Learned Attorney General points out that the judgment in Dr. J.J. Merchand
and Ors. v. Shrinath Chaturvedi reported in [MANU/SC/0668/2002 : 2002 (6)
SCC 635], has been considered and a different view has been taken in Kailash
v. Nanhku and Ors. reported in [MANU/SC/0264/2005 : 2005 (4) SCC 480], on
the issue of limitation. The matters, therefore, require consideration.
3. Delay condoned.4. The appeals are admitted.
5 . Since this point of law requires to be resolved, we request the Hon'ble the
Chief Justice to place these appeals before a larger Bench....
2. In the aforestated circumstances, these matters have been placed before this three-
Judge Bench so as to ascertain whether the law laid down in the case of Dr. J.J.
Merchant (supra) still holds the field or whether the law has been changed in view of
the later judgment delivered by this Court in the case of Kailash (supra).
3. The whole issue centers round the period within which the opponent has to give his
version to the District Forum in pursuance of a complaint, which is admitted Under
Section 12 of the Act. Upon receipt of a complaint by the District Forum, if the
complaint is admitted Under Section 12 of the Act, a copy of the complaint is to be
served upon the opposite party and as per provisions of Section 13 of the Act, the
opposite party has to give his version of the case within a period of 30 days from the
date of receipt of the copy of the complaint. There is a further provision in Section
13(2)(a) that the District Forum may extend the period, not exceeding 15 days, to the
opposite party for giving his version. The relevant Section of the Act reads as under:
13. Procedure on admission of complaint-(1) ....
(2) The District Forum shall, if the complaint admitted by it Under Section 12
relates to goods in respect of which the procedure specified in Sub-section (1)
cannot be followed, or if the complaint relates to any services,-
(a) refer a copy of such complaint to the opposite party directing him
to give his version of the case within a period of thirty days or such
extended period not exceeding fifteen days as may be granted by the
District Forum;
(b) ....
Thus, upon plain reading of the aforestated Section, one can find that the opposite party
is given 30 days' time for giving his version and the said period for filing or giving the
version can be extended by the District Forum, but the extension should not exceed 15
days. Thus, an upper cap of 45 days has been imposed by the Act for filing version of
the opposite party.
4. The question arose in the case of Dr. J.J. Merchant (supra) whether the Forum can
grant time beyond 45 days to the opposite party for filing its version. After considering
the aforestated section in the light of the object with which the Act has been enacted, a
three-Judge Bench of this Court came to the conclusion that in no case period beyond
45 days can be granted to the opposite party for filing its version of the case.
5 . Without discussing the aforestated three-Judge Bench judgment in detail, we now
turn to another judgment which has been referred to by the referring Bench. The other
judgment which has been referred to is Kailash (supra), which pertains to Election
Law. The issue involved in the said case was whether time limit of 90 days, as
prescribed by the proviso to Rule 1 of Order 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure, is
mandatory or directory in nature. The said issue had arisen in an election matter where
the written statement was not filed by the concerned candidate within the period
prescribed under the relevant Election Law and the issue was whether in the Election
trial, delay caused in filing the written statement could have been condoned.
6. After considering the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908 and several other judgments pertaining to grant of time or additional time for
filing written statement or reply, in the interest of justice, this Court came to the
conclusion that the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 Code of Civil Procedure are not
mandatory but directory in nature and therefore, in the interest of justice, further time
for filing reply can be granted, if the circumstances are such that require grant of
further time for filing the reply.
7. The judgment delivered in the case of Kailash (supra) is later in point of time and
while considering the said judgment, judgment delivered in the case of Dr. J.J.
Merchant (supra) had also been considered by this Court.
8. In the aforestated circumstances, we have now to consider whether in a case under
the provisions of the Act, where a complaint has been filed and the opposite party has
not filed its version to the case within 30 days or within extended period of 45 days,
which at the most could have been granted by the District Forum, the version given by
the opposite party can be accepted.
9 . The learned Counsel appearing for the complainant submitted that the view
expressed by the three-Judge Bench of this Court in Dr. J.J. Merchant (supra) is
absolutely just and proper and is on the subject, with which facts of the present case
are concerned. The said case also deals with the provisions of Section 13(2)(a) of the
Act, whereas case of Kailash (supra) pertains to an Election trial and under a different
Act.
10. According to the learned Counsel appearing for the complainant, in the instant case,
in fact, there is no conflict between the two judgments referred to hereinabove as the
judgment delivered in Dr. J.J. Merchant (supra) was prior in time and was on the
subject of the Act. Looking at the contents of the said judgment, it is clear that the said
judgment also pertains to the provisions with regard to grant of time for filing version
of the opposite party before the District Forum. Once a judgment has been delivered by
a three-Judge Bench on the same subject and on the same section, according to the
learned Counsel, there was no need to re-consider the same.
11. On the other hand, the learned Counsel appearing for the other side contended that
as per the view expressed in the case of Kailash (supra), the District Forum can grant
time beyond 15 days to the other side for giving its version or reply. The learned
Counsel submitted that the marginal note to Section 13 of the Act reads ""procedure on
completion of complaint'. Thus, the provisions incorporated in Section 13 of the Act are
merely procedural and are directory in nature, as observed by this Court in the case of
Kailash (supra).
12. The learned Counsel also referred to a judgment delivered in the case of Topline
Shoes Ltd. v. Corporation Bank [MANU/SC/0558/2002 : (2002) 6 SCC 33]. This
Court was faced with the same issue in the aforestated case. After discussing the
provisions of Section 13(2) of the Act, this Court came to the conclusion that procedural
rules should not be considered as mandatory in nature. In the said case, ultimately, this
Court came to the conclusion that provision contained in Section 13(2)(a) of the Act is
procedural in nature. According to the said judgment, the object behind enactment of
the Act is speedy disposal of cases pending before the District Forum and therefore, it
has been provided that reply should be filed within 30 days and the extension of time
may not exceed 15 days. It has been further observed that no penal consequences have
been provided in the case of extension of time beyond 15 days and therefore, the said
provision with regard to extension of time beyond a particular limit is directory in
nature and that would not mean that extension of time cannot exceed 15 days. Relying
upon the said judgment and the judgment delivered in the case of Kailash (supra), the
learned Counsel submitted that as Dr. J.J. Merchant (supra) has not been followed in
a later case though it was considered in the case of Kailash (supra), the correct legal
position would be to treat the said provision with regard to maximum period for filing
the reply is directory and not mandatory.
13. The learned Counsel further submitted that some of the provisions of Code of Civil
Procedure do apply to the District Forum and in the light of the said fact, in his
submission, the provisions of Section 13(2)(a) of the Act are merely directory and not
mandatory in nature.
14. The learned Counsel also submitted that if further time is not granted, irreparable
damage would be caused to the other side and in a case where the other
side/Respondent is staying at a distant place, it might not be possible for the
Respondent/other side to file its version even within 45 days and therefore, in the
interest of justice, the view expressed in the case of Kailash (supra) should be
accepted.
1 5 . Upon hearing the concerned counsel and upon perusal of both the judgments
referred to hereinabove, which pertain to extension of time for the purpose of filing
written statement, we are of the opinion that the view expressed by the three-Judge
Bench of this Court in Dr. J.J. Merchant (supra) should prevail.
16. In the case of Dr. J.J. Merchant (supra), which is on the same subject, this Court
observed as under:
13. The National Commission or the State Commission is empowered to follow
the said procedure. From the aforesaid section it is apparent that on receipt of
the complaint, the opposite party is required to be given notice directing him to
give his version of the case within a period of 30 days or such extended period
not exceeding 15 days as may be granted by the District Forum or the
Commission. For having speedy trial, this legislative mandate of not giving
more than 45 days in submitting the written statement or the version of the
case is required to be adhered to. If this is not adhered to, the legislative
mandate of disposing of the cases within three or five months would be
defeated.
14. For this purpose, even Parliament has amended Order 8 Rule 1 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, which reads thus:
1. Written statement.-The Defendant shall, within thirty days from the
date of service of summons on him, present a written statement of his
defence:
Provided that where the Defendant fails to file the written
statement within the said period of thirty days, he shall be
allowed to file the same on such other day, as may be specified
by the court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, but which
shall not be later than ninety days from the date of service of
summons.
15. Under this Rule also, there is a legislative mandate that written statement
of defence is to be filed within 30 days. However, if there is a failure to file
such written statement within the stipulated time, the court can at the most
extend further period of 60 days and no more. Under the Act, the legislative
intent is not to give 90 days of time but only maximum 45 days for filing the
version of the opposite party. Therefore, the aforesaid mandate is required to
be strictly adhered to.
17. We are, therefore, of the view that the judgment delivered in the case of Dr. J.J.
Merchant (supra) holds the field and therefore, we reiterate the view that the District
Forum can grant a further period of 15 days to the opposite party for filing his version
or reply and not beyond that..
1 8 . There is one more reason to follow the law laid down in the case of Dr. J.J.
Merchant (supra). Dr. J.J. Merchant (supra) was decided in 2002, whereas Kailash
(supra) was decided in 2005. As per law laid down by this Court, while deciding the
case of Kailash (supra), this Court ought to have respected the view expressed in Dr.
J.J. Merchant (supra) as the judgment delivered in the case of Dr. J.J. Merchant
(supra) was earlier in point of time. The aforestated legal position cannot be ignored by
us and therefore, we are of the opinion that the view expressed in Dr. J.J. Merchant
(supra) should be followed.
19. Our aforestated view has also been buttressed by the view expressed by this Court
in the case of Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community and Anr. v. State of
Maharashtra and Anr. [MANU/SC/1069/2004 : (2005) 2 SCC 673], wherein a
question had arisen whether the law laid down by a Bench of a larger strength is
binding on a subsequent Bench of lesser or equal strength. After considering a number
of judgments, a five-Judge Bench of this Court, finally opined as under:
12. Having carefully considered the submissions made by the learned senior
Counsel for the parties and having examined the law laid down by the
Constitution Benches in the abovesaid decisions, we would like to sum up the
legal position in the following terms:
(1) The law laid down by this Court in a decision delivered by a Bench
of larger strength is binding on any subsequent Bench of lesser or coequal
strength.
(2) A Bench of lesser quorum cannot disagree or dissent from the view
of the law taken by a Bench of larger quorum. In case of doubt all that
the Bench of lesser quorum can do is to invite the attention of the Chief
Justice and request for the matter being placed for hearing before a
Bench of larger quorum than the Bench whose decision has come up
for consideration. It will be open only for a Bench of coequal strength
to express an opinion doubting the correctness of the view taken by the
earlier Bench of coequal strength, whereupon the matter may be placed
for hearing before a Bench consisting of a quorum larger than the one
which pronounced the decision laying down the law the correctness of
which is doubted.
(3) The above rules are subject to two exceptions: (i) The abovesaid
rules do not bind the discretion of the Chief Justice in whom vests the
power of framing the roster and who can direct any particular matter to
be placed for hearing before any particular Bench of any strength; and
(ii) In spite of the rules laid down hereinabove, if the matter has
already come up for hearing before a Bench of larger quorum and that
Bench itself feels that the view of the law taken by a Bench of lesser
quorum, which view is in doubt, needs correction or reconsideration
then by way of exception (and not as a rule) and for reasons given by
it, it may proceed to hear the case and examine the correctness of the
previous decision in question dispensing with the need of a specific
reference or the order of Chief Justice constituting the Bench and such
listing. Such was the situation in Raghubir Singh and Hansoli Devi.
20. In view of the aforestated clear legal position depicted by a five-Judge Bench, the
subject is no more res integra. Not only this three-Judge Bench, but even a Bench of
coordinate strength of this Court, which had decided the case of Kailash (supra), was
bound by the view taken by a three-Judge Bench in the case of Dr. J.J. Merchant
(supra).
21. In view of the aforestated legal position, we are of the view that the law laid down
by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Dr. J.J. Merchant (supra) should
prevail. The Reference is answered accordingly.","Appellants: New India Assurance Co. Ltd.

Facts:
While considering Civil Appeal, this Court expressed its doubt in relation to
the period of limitation for filing the written statement or giving version of
the opponent as per the provisions of Section 13(2)(a) of the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 (the Act). The question was, whether the said issue was
governed by the law laid down by this Court in Dr. J.J. Merchant and Ors. v.
Shrinath Chaturvedi or Kailash v. Nanhku and Ors. In the aforesaid
circumstances, these matters have been placed before this three-judge Bench
so as to ascertain whether the law laid down in Dr. J.J. Merchant and Ors. v.
Shrinath Chaturvedi still holds the field or the law has been changed in view
of the later judgment.
The whole issue centers round the period within which the opponent has to
give his version to the District Forum in pursuance of a complaint, which is
admitted Under Section 12 of the Act. Upon receipt of a complaint by the
District Forum, if the complaint is admitted Under Section 12 of the Act, a
copy of the complaint is to be served upon the opposite party and as per
provisions of Section 13 of the Act, the opposite party has to give his version
of the case within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of the copy of
the complaint. There is a further provision in Section 13(2)(a) that the
District Forum may extend the period, not exceeding 15 days, to the opposite
party for giving his version.
The question arose in the case of Dr. J.J. Merchant and Ors. v. Shrinath
Chaturvedi that whether the forum can grant time beyond 45 days to the
opposite party for filing its version. The three-judge Bench came to the
conclusion that in no case period beyond 45 days can be granted to the
opposite party for filing its version of the case.
The other judgment which has been referred to is Kailash v. Nanhku and Ors,
which pertains to Election Law. The issue involved in the said case was
whether time limit of 90 days, as prescribed by the proviso to Rule 1 of Order
8 of the Code of Civil Procedure, is mandatory or directory in nature. The
Court came to the conclusion that the provisions of Order 8 Rule 1, Code of
Civil Procedure are not mandatory but directory in nature and therefore,
further time for filing reply can be granted, if the circumstances are such that
require grant of further time.
Held, while disposing of the Reference:
1. Upon hearing the concerned counsel and upon perusal of both the
judgments referred to hereinabove, which pertain to extension of time for the
purpose of filing written statement, the Court is of the opinion that the view
expressed by the three-Judge Bench of this Court in Dr. J.J. Merchant and Ors.
v. Shrinath Chaturvedi should prevail.[15]
2. In the case of Dr. J. J. Merchant and Ors. v. Shrinath Chaturvedi, which is
on the same subject, this Court observed as under:16
The National Commission or the State Commission is empowered to follow the
said procedure. From the aforesaid section it is apparent that on receipt of the
complaint, the opposite party is required to be given notice directing him to
give his version of the case within a period of 30 days or such extended
period not exceeding 15 days as may be granted by the District Forum or the
Commission. For having speedy trial, this legislative mandate of not giving
more than 45 days in submitting the written statement or the version of the
case is required to be adhered to. If this is not adhered to, the legislative
mandate of disposing of the cases within three or five months would be
defeated...
3. The Court is, therefore, of the view that the judgment delivered in the case
of Dr. J. J. Merchant and Ors. v. Shrinath Chaturvedi, holds the field and
therefore, the Court reiterates the view that the District Forum can grant a
further period of 15 days to the opposite party for filing his version or reply
and not beyond that.[17]
4. There is one more reason to follow the law laid down in the case of Dr. J. J.
Merchant and Ors. v. Shrinath Chaturvedi. It was decided in 2002, whereas
Kailash v. Nanhku and Ors. was decided in 2005. As per law laid down by this
Court, while deciding the case of Kailash v. Nanhku and Ors., this Court ought
to have respected the view expressed in Dr. J. J. Merchant and Ors. v.
Shrinath Chaturvedi as the judgment delivered in Dr. J. J. Merchant case was
earlier in point of time. The aforestated legal position cannot be ignored by
the Court and therefore, this Court is of the opinion that the view expressed
in Dr. J.J. Merchant should be followed.[18]
5. In view of the aforestated clear legal position depicted by a five-Judge
Bench, the subject is no more res integra. Not only this three-Judge Bench,
but even a Bench of coordinate strength of this Court, which had decided the
case of Kailash v. Nanhku and Ors., was bound by the view taken by a three-
Judge Bench in the case of Dr. J.J. Merchant and Ors. v. Shrinath Chaturvedi.
[20]
6. In view of the aforesaid legal position, the Court is of the view that the law
laid down by a three-judge Bench of this Court in the case of Dr. J. J.
Merchant and Ors. v. Shrinath Chaturvedi should prevail. The Reference is
answered accordingly.[21]",,,,

1. Leave granted.
2 . This civil appeal by special leave is directed against the impugned judgment and
order dated 23.09.2013 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission, New Delhi in Revision Petition No. 4047 of 2006 whereby it has allowed
the revision petition filed by Respondent Nos. 1-4 and set aside the order dated
12.10.2006 passed by the Gujarat State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,
Ahemedabad in Appeal No. 741 of 2006.
3. The brief facts of the case in nutshell are as under:
The Appellant No. 1-Lourdes Society Snehanjali Girls Hostel is a society
registered under the Societies Registration Act vide society registration No.
Guj/525/Surat and also a trust registered, vide its Trust registration No.
F/430/Surat. The Appellant-Society is a charitable institution running a girls
hostel at Surat for the benefit of Adiwasi children. On 02.02.2000, the
Appellant-Society purchased vitrified glazed floor tiles from Respondent No. 5
(since deleted from the array of parties vide Court's order dated 01.04.2015)
who was a local agent of Respondent No. 1-Company for a sum of Rs.
4,69,579/-. The said tiles, after its fixation in the premises of the hostel,
gradually developed black and white spots. The Appellant No. 1 wrote several
letters to Respondent No. 4 i.e., Sales Executive of Respondent No. 1-company,
informing about the inferior and defective quality of the tiles. Thereafter, the
Respondent No. 5-local agent visited the spot but failed to solve the issue.
4 . An architect J.M. Vimawala was appointed by the Appellant-Society to assess the
damage caused due to defective tiles. The architect assessed the loss to the tune of Rs.
4,27,712.37 which included price of the tiles, labour charges, octroi and transportation
charges. Thereafter, the Appellant-Society served a legal notice dated 12.08.2002 to the
Respondents making a demand of the said amount but no response was shown by the
Respondents.
5. The said inaction on the part of the Respondents made the Appellant-Society to file a
Consumer Complaint No. 743 of 2002 against the Respondents before the District
Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum at Surat (for short ""the District Forum"") for claim
of the said amount.
6 . The District Forum appointed a Court Commissioner to examine and find out the
manufacturing defects in the tiles as claimed by the Appellant-Society. After
examination, the Court Commissioner submitted a report dated 21.09.2004 stating
therein that the tiles were having manufacturing defect.
7. The District Forum vide its order dated 31.12.2005 held that the tiles supplied by the
Respondents had manufacturing defect. The Respondents committed an unfair trade
practice by supplying such defective tiles. By holding the Respondents jointly and
severally liable, the District Forum directed the Respondents to pay to the Appellants a
sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- along with interest @9% p.a. from the date of complaint i.e.,
31.10.2002 till its recovery. The Respondent No. 1 was directed to pay the above
amount to the Appellant within a period of 30 days from the date of order of the District
Forum.
8. Being Aggrieved, the Respondents filed First Appeal No. 741 of 2006 before Gujarat
State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, Ahmedabad (for short ""the State
Commission"") challenging the said order of District Forum urging various grounds.
9 . The State Commission dismissed the said First Appeal of the Respondents by its
order dated 12.10.2006 and confirmed the order passed by the District Forum.
10. Having become unsuccessful before the State Commission, the Respondents filed
Revision Petition No. 4047 of 2006 before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as ""the National Commission"")
questioning the validity and correctness of the order passed by the District Forum and
the State Commission.
11. On 12.03.2012, the Appellant-Society also made an application being I.A. No. 1847
of 2013 in Revision Petition No. 4047 of 2006 to the National Commission for invoking
the powers Under Sections 14(d) and 14(hb) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and
for awarding sufficient amount of compensation in addition to amount already awarded
by the District Forum.
12. The National Commission vide its order dated 23.09.2013 reversed the findings of
the District Forum and the State Commission holding that the Appellant-Society has
failed to establish that it is a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
1 3 . In support of their case, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of both the
parties made the following submissions.
Mr. Ashok Panigrahi, the learned Counsel on behalf of the Appellant-Society contended
that the National Commission has erred in coming to the conclusion that the Appellant-
Society is a commercial establishment and thus, not covered by the definition of the
term 'consumer' Under Section 2(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. It was
further submitted by him that it is unjustified on the part of the National Commission to
hold that the Memorandum of Association and byelaws of the Appellant-society which
show that it is a charitable institution and not any commercial establishment were not
filed before the District Forum but filed at the stage of Revision before the National
Commission. It was further submitted by the learned Counsel that the District Forum
and the State Commission have gone through the registration certificate and
Memorandum of Association of the Appellant-Society.
14. He further submitted that the National Commission has erred in holding that the
case M/s. Kusumam Hotels Pvt. Ltd. v. Neycer India Ltd. III (1993) CPJ 333 (NC)
is applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case.
15. It was further contended by him that both the District Forum as well as the State
Commission have held that the Appellant-Society cannot be regarded as a commercial
establishment. It is completely unjustified on the part of the National Commission to
hold that the Appellant-Society being a commercial establishment is not a consumer
within the meaning of the term 'consumer' Under Section 2(d) of the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 in complete ignorance of the Memorandum of Association and the
byelaws of the Appellant-Society.
1 6 . On the contrary, Mr. Sudhir K. Makkar, the learned Counsel on behalf of the
Respondents sought to justify the impugned judgment and order of the National
Commission contending that the same is based on sound reasoning without error and
therefore, the same need not be interfered with by this Court.
17. It is further contended by him that the District Forum and the State Commission
have erred in relying on the report dated 21.09.2004 given by the Court Commissioner
as his qualification was not stated in the report. The report was based on visual
inspection. Further, both the District Forum as well as the State Commission have erred
in not considering the test certificate produced by Respondent No. 1 as the same was
based on modern tile testing technology in its laboratory. In the absence of expert
evidence, it was wrong on the part of the District Forum as well as the State
Commission to hold that tiles had manufacturing defect.
18. After hearing the learned Counsel for both the parties we come to the following
conclusion:
The National Commission has exceeded its jurisdiction in exercising its
revisional power Under Section 21(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 by
setting aside the concurrent finding of fact recorded by the State Commission in
First Appeal No. 741 of 2006 vide its judgment dated 12.10.2006 wherein the
finding of fact recorded by the District Forum was affirmed.
19. The facts of the instant case clearly reveal that the National Commission has erred
in observing that the Appellant-Society is a commercial establishment by completely
ignoring the Memorandum of Association and byelaws of the Appellant-Society. Both
the District Forum as well as the State Commission have rightly held that the Appellant-
Society is a charitable institution and not a commercial entity. The relevant portion of
the order passed by the District Forum reads thus:
6 . ......It is not in dispute that complainants are running girls hostel in the
name of Complainant No. 1. Commercial purpose is also explained under the
provisions of the Act. So far as activities of the complainants are concerned,
they are running girls hostel and receive fees from the students. The
complainants are not carrying out commercial activities. Purchase of goods
namely tiles are for the purpose of their hostel and it cannot be said that tiles is
subject matter of their business. Whenever any person purchases goods for
carrying out business for commercial or for livelihood then only question
regarding purchase of goods or availing any activities from trader or
professional arises. The complainants are not carrying on business of purchase
from opponents. Otherwise also hostel premises can be constructed and there is
no direct relation between commercial activity. Therefore, the defence of
opponents that complainants are carrying on business activities and thereby
complainants are not consumer is not acceptable. Hence, we hold that
complainants are consumer of opponents and defence of opponents is rejected.
20. The National Commission has erred by applying the decision in M/s. Kusumam
Hotels Pvt. Ltd. case (supra) in holding that the Appellant-Society is not a consumer
in terms of the definition Under Section 2(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 as
the purchase of tiles and laying in the same in the rooms of the girl's hostel run by the
Appellant-Society is clearly not for any commercial purpose. The decision in M/s.
Kusumam Hotels Pvt. Ltd. case (supra) has no application to the present fact
situation for the reason that in the said case complainant was a hotel and the tiles
purchased by the hotel were for commercial purpose as the hotel business involves the
act of profit making, whereas in the instant case the girl's hostel in question is run by
the Appellant-Society as one among its various charitable activities for the benefit of
adivasi students. The Appellant-Society is supporting adivasi/tribal girls to pursue their
education by providing hostel facilities. The expenses for the food and electricity are
being paid by the inmates of the hostel. The Appellant-Society is maintaining the hostel
free of cost and no charges in the form of rent, repairs and maintenance are collected
from the inmates. Thus, the Appellant-Society cannot be considered as any commercial
establishment striving for profit.
21. Further, the National Commission while passing the impugned order has ignored
certain facts which throws light on callous attitude on the part of the Respondents viz.,
when the defect in the tiles were brought to the notice of the Respondents by sending
various letters, there was no action on their part. Later a local agent on behalf of the
Respondent No. 1-Company visited the premises of the girl's hostel and verified that the
said tiles were defective and damaged. However, no proper attention was paid by the
Respondents towards the issue. Further, to assess the damage caused to the Appellant-
Society by the use of the said defective tiles, a registered architect and interior
designer, J.M. Vimawala was hired by the Appellant-Society, who in his report declared
the tiles to be defective and assessed the damage to the Appellant-Society to the tune
of Rs. 4,27,712.37. Thereafter, the Appellant-Society made a demand of the said
amount as damages from the Respondents vide legal notice dated 12.08.2002. But the
Respondents did not pay any heed to the said notice as well. Because of such
irresponsible and indifferent attitude on the part of the Respondents, the Appellant-
Society was compelled to file Consumer Complaint No. 743 of 2002 before the District
Forum.
22. The District Forum, after appreciating the pleadings and evidence on record has
rightly awarded Rs. 2 lakhs as damages to the Appellant-Society towards defective tiles
supplied by the Respondents along with compensation towards mental harassment and
cost of present proceedings with interest @9% p.a. from the date of complaint till its
recovery. In concurring with the findings of the District Forum, the State Commission,
after proper re-appreciation of the facts and evidence on record has rightly exercised its
jurisdiction by dismissing the appeal of the Respondents. The National Commission
should not have interfered with the concurrent findings of fact recorded in the judgment
impugned before it particularly having regard to the nature of the jurisdiction conferred
upon it by Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Section 21 of the aforesaid
Act reads thus:
21. Jurisdiction of the National Commission.-- Subject to the other provisions
of this Act, the National Commission shall have jurisdiction--
(a) to entertain--
(i) complaints where the value of the goods or services and
compensation, if any, claimed exceeds rupees one crore; and
(ii) appeals against the orders of any State Commission; and
(b) to call for the records and pass appropriate orders in any consumer
dispute which is pending before or has been decided by any State
Commission where it appears to the National Commission that such
State Commission has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law,
or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or has acted in the
exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity.
23. The National Commission has to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it only if the
State Commission or the District Forum has either failed to exercise their jurisdiction or
exercised when the same was not vested in them or exceeded their jurisdiction by
acting illegally or with material irregularity. In the instant case, the National
Commission has certainly exceeded its jurisdiction by setting aside the concurrent
finding of fact recorded in the order passed by the State Commission which is based
upon valid and cogent reasons. The National Commission has reversed the order passed
by the State Commission by wrongly applying the decision of M/s. Kusumam Hotels
Pvt. Ltd. case (supra) to the set of facts in the present case. In the said case, the
complainant was a hotel, it was considered to be a commercial entity and therefore, it
was kept out of the purview of the definition of 'consumer' Under Section 2(d) of the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986. However, the National Commission has failed to
appreciate the fact that in the present case, the Appellant-Society is not a commercial
establishment rather a registered society helping the adivasi students in their education
by providing hostel facilities. The charges, if any, for accommodation in the hostel are
for maintaining the hostel and not for making profit. Thus, the Appellant-Society is
consumer within the meaning of the term 'consumer' Under Section 2(d) of the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The National Commission has erroneously accepted the
contention urged on behalf of the Respondents in the revisional proceedings that supply
of tiles to the Appellant-Society by Respondent No. 1 through its local agent is for
commercial purpose. The said finding is based on the decision in M/s. Kusumam
Hotels Pvt. Ltd. case (supra), which case absolutely has no application to the fact
situation.
2 4 . Therefore, the concurrent finding of fact recorded by the District and the State
Commission has been erroneously interfered with by the National Commission by
passing the impugned order, which is liable to be set aside. For the aforesaid reasons,
the appeal of the Appellant-Society must succeed.
2 5 . For the reasons stated supra this appeal is allowed, the impugned order of the

MATTERS RELATING TO CONSUMER PROTECTION - SLPs RELATING TO CONSUMER
PROTECTION
Facts:
The Appellant-Society purchased vitrified glazed floor tiles from Respondent
No. 5/local agent of Respondent No. 1-Company. The said tiles, after its
fixation in the premises of the hostel, gradually developed black and white
spots. The Appellant No. 1 wrote several letters to Respondent No. 4 i.e.,
Sales Executive of Respondent No. 1-Company, informing about the inferior
and defective quality of the tiles. Thereafter, the Respondent No. 5-local
agent visited the spot but failed to solve the issue. An architect was
appointed by the Appellant-Society to assess the damage caused due to
defective tiles. The architect assessed the loss to the tune of Rs. 4,27,712.37
which included price of the tiles, labour charges, octroi and transportation
charges. Thereafter, the Appellant-Society served a legal notice to the
Respondents making a demand of the said amount but no response was
shown by the Respondents. The said inaction on the part of the Respondents
made the Appellant-Society to file a Consumer Complaint against the
Respondents before the District Forum. The District Forum appointed a Court
Commissioner to examine and find out the manufacturing defects in the tiles
as claimed by the Appellant-Society. The Court Commissioner submitted a
report stating therein that the tiles were having manufacturing defect. The
District Forum held that the tiles supplied by the Respondents had
manufacturing defect. The Respondents committed an unfair trade practice by
supplying such defective tiles. By holding the Respondents jointly and
severally liable, the District Forum directed the Respondents to pay to the
Appellants a sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- along with interest. Being Aggrieved, the
Respondents filed appeal before the State Commission challenging the said
order of District Forum urging various grounds. The State Commission
dismissed the said appeal of the Respondents. The Respondents filed revision
petition before the National Commission. The Appellant-Society also made an
application to the National Commission for invoking the powers under
Sections 14(d) and 14(hb) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and for
awarding sufficient amount of compensation in addition to amount already
awarded by the District Forum. The National Commission reversed the
findings of the District Forum and the State Commission holding that the
Appellant-Society failed to establish that it was a consumer within the
meaning of Section 2(d) of the Act, 1986. Hence, present appeal.
Held, while allowing the appeal:
(i) The National Commission exceeded its jurisdiction in exercising its
revisional power under Section 21(b) of the Act, 1986 by setting aside the
concurrent finding of fact recorded by the State Commission vide its judgment
wherein the finding of fact recorded by the District Forum was affirmed. [18]
(ii) The National Commission erred in observing that the Appellant-Society
was a commercial establishment by completely ignoring the Memorandum of
Association and byelaws of the Appellant-Society. Both the District Forum as
well as the State Commission rightly held that the Appellant-Society is a
charitable institution and not a commercial entity. [19]
(iii) The girl's hostel in question was run by the Appellant-Society as one
among its various charitable activities for the benefit of adivasi students. The
Appellant-Society was supporting adivasi/tribal girls to pursue their
education by providing hostel facilities. The expenses for the food and
electricity were being paid by the inmates of the hostel. The Appellant-
Society was maintaining the hostel free of cost and no charges in the form of
rent, repairs and maintenance are collected from the inmates. Thus, the
Appellant-Society could not be considered as any commercial establishment
striving for profit. [20]
(iv) The National Commission should not have interfered with the concurrent
findings of fact recorded in the judgment impugned before it particularly
having regard to the nature of the jurisdiction conferred upon it by Section 21
of the Act, 1986. [22]
(v) The National Commission erroneously accepted the contention urged on
behalf of the Respondents in the revisional proceedings that supply of tiles to
the Appellant-Society by Respondent No. 1 through its local agent is for
commercial purpose. [23]
(vi) The impugned order of the National Commission was hereby set aside and
the order of the District Forum which was affirmed by the State Commission
was restored. [25]",,,,

1. This Appeal is filed challenging the order dated 25.09.2007 of the National Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as 'National
Commission') by which an order of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,
Union Territory, Chandigarh (hereinafter referred to as 'State Commission') awarding
compensation to the Respondent was confirmed.
2 . The Respondent was allotted Plot No. 40, measuring 40 marlas in Sector 8, Urban
Estate, Karnal on 03.04.1987. As physical possession of the plot was not given to her
by the Appellants, the Respondent filed Original Complaint No. 54 of 1997 before the
State Commission. In the said complaint, the Respondent alleged that she had paid the
full price of the plot including the enhancement fee as per the terms and conditions of
the allotment letter. She averred that she was not given the possession of the plot in
spite of repeated requests. The Respondent also pleaded in the complaint that the
Appellants were required to complete the development work within 2 years from the
date of the allotment letter and hand over the physical possession. She further stated
that she wanted to construct a house and the delay in handing over physical possession
of the plot resulted in additional expenditure for the building as the price of
construction material increased manifold from 1988 to 1997. On the basis of the above
averments, the Respondent sought for the following reliefs in Original Complaint No. 54
of 1997:
i. That the opposite party be directed not to charge any extension fees for not
constructing the plot within the stipulated period which could not be done
because of non delivery of the physical possession of the plot.
ii. HUDA be directed not to charge interest at all on the amount because the
HUDA had offered a paper possession in the year 1982 and had not handed over
the physical/actual possession till date.
iii. HUDA be directed to deliver the physical possession immediately after
completing development work as per the brochure and advertisement and after
providing the community service such as schools, community centre, hospital
etc. in the sector.
iv. The HUDA be directed to give compensation of 1.00 lac against harassment
mental agony suffered due to the act and conduct of HUDA.
v. Directed to give cost to the complainant for Rs. 20,000/- against the
expenditure incurred in filing this complaint and as well as for spending the
amount for visiting the office of the last 8 years.
vi. The complainant be awarded interest at the rate of 18% on the amount
deposited on various time till the actual possession of the plot is given.
vii. The Respondent be directed to pay Rs. 5.00 lac escalation cost of the
construction material.
3. The Appellants filed a written statement in which it was stated that the Respondent
was allotted the plot from the Government Discretionary Quota vide Allotment Letter
No. 5049 dated 03.04.1987. The Appellants alleged that the Respondent did not seek
delivery of possession prior to 16.07.1997. It was also stated in the written statement
that an amount of Rs. 28,000/- was still outstanding. It was further alleged that the
Respondent was not interested in constructing a house and that no building plan was
submitted for approval.
4 . The State Commission by its order dated 21.12.1998 held that the Respondent has
established deficiency of service by the Appellants as there was delay in handing over
physical possession of the plot. The complaint was allowed and the Appellants were
directed to deliver vacant physical possession of the plot, if not already done, to the
Respondent within one month from the date of receipt of the order. There was a further
direction to pay interest on the amount deposited by the Respondent at the rate of 12%
with effect from 03.04.1989 and to pay a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as compensation on
account of escalation in the cost of construction etc. The Appellants were also directed
to pay Rs. 20,000/- towards compensation for monetary loss and mental harassment
suffered by the Respondent.
5 . Aggrieved by the said order dated 21.12.1998 of the State Commission, the
Appellants filed an appeal before the National Commission. The National Commission
confined the dispute in First Appeal No. 154 of 1999 only to the award of compensation
of Rs. 2 lakhs relating to escalation in cost of construction. The other reliefs pertaining
to payment of compensation towards monetary loss and mental harassment of Rs.
20,000/- and interest on the amount deposited by the Respondent were confirmed. The
National Commission remanded the matter for re-consideration of compensation for
escalation of cost of construction in accordance with CPWD rates.
6. The State Commission reconsidered the matter and permitted both sides to produce
evidence which would enable it to compute the compensation for escalation of
construction cost as per CPWD rates. The Respondent produced evidence to show that
the escalation in cost of construction between April, 1989 and January, 2000 would be
Rs. 18,67,000/-. An affidavit dated 06.02.2007 was filed by Sh. Vikram Singh Malik,
Estate Officer, HUDA, Karnal on behalf of the Appellants in which it was stated that the
physical possession of the plot was given to the Respondent on 21.01.2000. The
Respondent submitted a building plan only on 14.02.2006 which would clearly prove
that the Respondent was not interested in constructing the house. The submission of the
Appellants that the Respondent was not entitled for more than Rs. 2,00,000/- towards
increase in the construction cost was rejected by the State Commission on the ground
that the National Commission directed computation of compensation at CPWD rates and
that there was no restriction in the order of remand. The material produced by the
Respondent to prove escalation in the cost of construction was accepted by the State
Commission which held that the Respondent was entitled for a sum of Rs. 18,67,000/-
as compensation. However, the State Commission held that since the Respondent did
not commence construction till 2006 with a view to get more compensation. Therefore,
she was awarded a compensation of Rs. 15,00,000/- instead of Rs. 18,67,000/- towards
increase in the cost of construction.
7. The National Commission by an order dated 25.09.2007 dismissed Appeal No. 525 of
2007 filed by the Appellants and confirmed the order passed by the State Commission
holding that the compensation awarded was just and reasonable. According to the
National Commission even if 15 % interest on the amount of Rs. 5 lakhs claimed by the
Respondent for 10 years is awarded, the Respondent would be entitled to Rs. 12.5
lakhs. Aggrieved by the order dated 15.09.2007 in First Appeal No. 525 of 2007 of the
National Commission, the Appellants have filed this Appeal.
8. The Counsel for the Appellants submitted that the Respondent was allotted the plot in
the Government Discretionary Quota and that the Respondent did not approach the
Appellants seeking possession of the plot till 1997. He also submitted that the
Respondent did not commence the construction till 2006 though she was given
possession on 21.01.2000. He further contended that the State Commission erred in
awarding Rs. 15 lakhs as compensation when the earlier order granting Rs. 2 lakhs as
compensation was not challenged by the Respondent. According to him, the remand by
the National Commission was to examine whether the Respondent was entitled to Rs. 2
lakhs as compensation which meant that she cannot be given any compensation beyond
Rs. 2,00,000/-.
9 . The Counsel for the Respondent submitted that there was no restriction in the
remand by the National Commission as the compensation towards escalation of the cost
of construction was directed to be calculated as per CPWD rates. He submitted that the
State Commission was right in awarding Rs. 15 lakhs as compensation when the
deficiency of service by the Appellant in not handing over the possession of the plot till
2000 was proved. He also urged that the Code of Civil Procedure has limited application
in the Consumer Fora and relief cannot be denied on the grounds of defective pleadings
and the relief sought. He also submitted that cogent material was placed before the
State Commission to prove the escalation in the cost of construction between 1989 and
2000.
10. The avowed object of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is to provide for better
protection of the interest of consumers. The statement of the objects and reasons, inter
alia, provides for a speedy and simple redressal to consumer disputes. The quasi
judicial bodies at the District, State and Central levels were empowered to give relief to
the consumers and award, wherever appropriate, compensation to consumers.
11. Section 14(1)(d) of the Act which is relevant for the adjudication of the dispute in
this case is as follows:
1 4 . Finding of the District Forum.-(1) If, after the proceeding conducted
Under Section 13, the District Forum is satisfied that the goods complained
against suffer from any of the defects specified in the complaint or that any of
the allegations contained in the complaint about the services are proved, it shall
issue an order to the opposite party directing him to do one or more of the
following things, namely:
.......
(d) to pay such amount as may be awarded by it as compensation to
the consumer for any loss or injury suffered by the consumer due to the
negligence of the opposite party.
12. The sine qua non for entitlement of compensation is proof of loss or injury suffered
by the consumer due to the negligence of the opposite party. Once the said conditions
are satisfied, the Consumer Forum would have to decide the quantum of compensation
to which the consumer is entitled. There cannot be any dispute that the computation of
compensation has to be fair, reasonable and commensurate to the loss or injury. There
is a duty cast on the Consumer Forum to take into account all relevant factors for
arriving at the compensation to be paid.
1 3 . I n Charan Singh v. Healing Touch Hospital and Ors. reported in
MANU/SC/0588/2000 : (2000) 7 SCC 668, this Court held as follows:
12. ... Indeed, calculation of damages depends on the facts and circumstances
of each case. No hard and fast Rule can be laid down for universal application.
While awarding compensation, a Consumer Forum has to take into account all
relevant factors and assess compensation on the basis of accepted legal
principles, on moderation. It is for the Consumer Forum to grant compensation
to the extent it finds it reasonable, fair and proper in the facts and
circumstances of a given case according to the established judicial standards
where the claimant is able to establish his charge.
I n Ghaziabad Development Authority v. Balbir Singh, reported in
MANU/SC/1027/2004 : (2004) 4 SCC 65, this Court was considering the compensation
to be awarded to the consumers in cases of deficiency of service by Development
Authorities like the Appellant herein and Ghaziabad Development Authority. Considering
a situation similar to the one that arises in the instant case, it was held as follows:
9. That compensation cannot be uniform and can best be illustrated by
considering cases where possession is being directed to be delivered and cases
where only monies are directed to be returned. In cases where possession is
being directed to be delivered the compensation for harassment will necessarily
have to be less because in a way that party is being compensated by increase in
the value of the property he is getting.
*** *** ***
11. Further, in cases where the Commission/Forum has directed delivery of
possession, the party has to a certain extent already got a benefit. The cost of
the land/flat would have gone up in the meantime. of course, even in cases,
where delivery of possession has been directed there could be compensation for
the harassment/loss. But such compensation has to be worked out after looking
into the facts of each case and after determining what is the amount of
harassment/loss which has been caused to the consumer.
14. It is undisputed that the Appellant handed over the plot to the Respondent only in
the year 2000 instead of 1989. The Respondent had paid Rs. 1,22,400/- towards the
cost of the plot at the rates prevailing in the year of allotment i.e. 1986. There is no
dispute that the Respondent was paid Rs. 1,28,188/- towards interest awarded by the
State Commission. There is also no dispute about the fact that the Respondent did not
commence construction till 2006. The State Commission while awarding the
compensation of Rs. 15 lakhs towards escalation in the cost of construction commented
on the conduct of the Respondent in delaying the construction only with a view to claim
higher compensation.
1 5 . The point that falls for our consideration in this case is whether the State
Commission was justified in awarding Rs. 15 lakhs towards the escalation in the cost of
construction as compensation. We are of the view that the Respondent is not entitled to
such compensation awarded by the State Commission and confirmed by the National
Commission. The Respondent suffered an injury due to the delay in handing over the
possession as there was definitely escalation in the cost of construction. At the same
time the Respondent has surely benefited by the increase in the cost of plot between
1989 to 2000. In our opinion, the order of the State Commission is vitiated for non
application of mind to a vital and relevant factor and hence, suffers from the vice of
unreasonableness. The State Commission criticized the conduct of the Respondent in
intentionally delaying the construction for 6 years but still proceeded to award
compensation. In the facts and circumstances of this case, we are of the opinion that
award of interest would have been sufficient to compensate the Respondent for the loss
suffered by him due to the delay in handing over the possession of the plot. The
compensation of Rs. 15 lakhs awarded by the State Commission is excessive. As we
have not reversed the impugned order on any other ground, it is not necessary for us to
delve into other points that were urged by the Respondent.
1 6 . For the aforementioned reasons, the Order of the State Commission dated
05.07.2007 as confirmed by the National Commission is set aside and the Appeal is
allowed. No costs.

Facts:
The present appeal filed challenging the order of the National Commission by
which an order of the State Commission awarding compensation to the
Respondent was confirmed. The State Commission held that the Respondent
had established deficiency of service by the Appellants as there was delay in
handing over physical possession of the plot. The Appellants were directed to
deliver vacant physical possession of the plot. There was a further direction to
pay interest on the amount deposited by the Respondent with compensation
on account of escalation in the cost of construction etc. The Appellants were
also directed to pay compensation for monetary loss and mental harassment
suffered by the Respondent. The Appellants filed an appeal before the
National Commission. The National Commission confined the dispute only to
the award of compensation relating to escalation in cost of construction. The
other reliefs pertaining to payment of compensation towards monetary loss
and mental harassment and interest on the amount deposited by the
Respondent were confirmed. The National Commission remanded the matter
for re-consideration of compensation for escalation of cost of construction in
accordance with CPWD rates.
The material produced by the Respondent to prove escalation in the cost of
construction was accepted by the State Commission which held that the
Respondent was entitled for compensation. However, the State Commission
held that since the Respondent did not commence construction till 2006 with
a view to get more compensation. Therefore, she was awarded a
compensation of Rs. 15,00,000/- instead of Rs. 18,67,000/- towards increase
in the cost of construction.
The National Commission dismissed appeal filed by the Appellants and
confirmed the order passed by the State Commission holding that the
compensation awarded was just and reasonable. According to the National
Commission even if 15 % interest on the amount of Rs. 5 lakhs claimed by
the Respondent for 10 years was awarded, the Respondent would be entitled
to Rs. 12.5 lakhs. Aggrieved by that order, the Appellants filed present appeal.
Held, while allowing the appeal:
(i) The sine qua non for entitlement of compensation is proof of loss or injury
suffered by the consumer due to the negligence of the opposite party. Once
the said conditions are satisfied, the Consumer Forum would have to decide
the quantum of compensation to which the consumer is entitled. There
cannot be any dispute that the computation of compensation has to be fair,
reasonable and commensurate to the loss or injury. There is a duty cast on
the Consumer Forum to take into account all relevant factors for arriving at
the compensation to be paid. [12]
(ii) The State Commission while awarding the compensation of Rs. 15 lakhs
towards escalation in the cost of construction commented on the conduct of
the Respondent in delaying the construction only with a view to claim higher
compensation. [14]
(iii) The Respondent was not entitled to such compensation. The Respondent
suffered an injury due to the delay in handing over the possession as there
was definitely escalation in the cost of construction. At the same time the
Respondent surely benefited by the increase in the cost of plot. The order of
the State Commission was vitiated for non application of mind to a vital and
relevant factor and hence, suffered from the vice of unreasonableness. The
State Commission criticized the conduct of the Respondent in intentionally
delaying the construction for 6 years but still proceeded to award
compensation. The award of interest would have been sufficient to
compensate the Respondent for the loss suffered by him due to the delay in
handing over the possession of the plot. The compensation awarded by the
State Commission was excessive. The impugned order was set aside. [15]",,,,
"1. Leave granted.
2. These appeals have been preferred by the Appellant-complainant Ms. K.A. Nagamani
against the order dated 4th August, 2011, read with execution order dated 14th
October, 2011 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New
Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the 'National Commission') whereby the National
Commission dismissed the Revision Petition as non-maintainable, affirmed the order
passed by the Consumer Fora and imposed the cost of Rs. 10,000/- on her on the
ground that she had wasted the time of the National Commission.
3 . The main grievance of the complainant is that the grant of 12% p.a. interest on
refund amount does not amount to a just compensation and that she is entitled for a
higher interest @ 27% per annum on the amount returned by the Respondent and a
further compensation in lieu of deficiency in service.
4 . On 20th January, 2012, a notice was issued to the Respondent-Karnataka Housing
Board (hereinafter referred to as the 'Housing Board') as to why the order passed by the
three Consumer Forums for payment of interest to the Appellant at the rate of 12% per
annum may not be set aside and a direction be issued for payment of interest at the rate
of 18% per annum and compensation in lieu of the deficiency in service. The
Respondent on appearance opposed the prayer and justified the order passed by the
three Consumer Forums.
5 . The case of the complainant is that pursuant to an advertisement published in the
newspaper and notification dated 11th April, 1991, she applied before the Housing
Board for allotment of HIG-B flat under Self Financing Housing Scheme (hereinafter
referred to as the ""SF Scheme"" for short) at Kengeri, Bangalore. In response to the said
application, the Respondent vide their letter dated 25.3.1992 allotted flat No. 116, Type
'B', First Floor at Kengeri under SFS scheme. Subsequently, by 'PROVISIONAL
INTIMATION OF ALLOTMENT' letter dated 23.4.1992 the Respondent informed her of the
provisional cost of the flat and the chart showing the dates on which instalments were
to be paid, as shown below:
6 . For payment of such instalments, the complainant had to avail a loan of Rs.
2,56,725/- from her employer (the Indian Airlines). A total sum of Rs. 2,67,750/- was
paid by her on the following dates:
7 . The grievance of the complainant is that though she was allotted flat No. 116 after
two and a half years of receipt of payment of instalments, the said flat was not handed
over to her. On the contrary, by letter dated 24.6.1995, she was informed that her
allotment was changed and that she had been allotted flat No. 64 HIG-B5 in Block No.
61 in lieu of the previous allotment with different terms and conditions as mentioned in
the said letter. It is stated that the cost of the subsequent flat is much higher (i.e. Rs.
5,90,000/-) than the cost of the earlier flat (i.e. Rs. 3,15,000/-). That means further
sum of Rs. 2,75,000/- is to be paid by the complainant.
8 . The complainant, thereafter, wrote different letters informing the Respondent that
she was not in a position to pay the higher amount and requested the allotment of the
flat which was earlier allotted to her. The Respondent by letter dated 31.1.1996
informed that the flat No. 116, Type-B allotted to her could not be constructed due to
the dispute raised by the land owners and the matter was pending before the Court. The
Respondent while acknowledging the payment of Rs. 2,67,750/- made by the
complainant, informed that taking into account the original cost of Rs. 3,15,000/-, a
further cost of Rs. 47,250/- was due from her.
9 . Further grievance of the complainant is that though she made different
representations from her Delhi address, no reply was received by her. Subsequently she
came to know that letters were forwarded at her Delhi address with address written in
'Kannada'. For the said reason many of the letters could not be served on her as the
Postal peon at Delhi had no knowledge of 'Kannada'. As it was not possible for her to
pay the additional sum of Rs. 3,22,250/- demanded by the Respondent, which was
beyond her earning capacity and exceeds the limit of loan to which she was entitled
from her organisation, the complainant requested the Respondent to return the amount
as they had failed to keep their promise in spite of the receipt of the full amount as per
the payment structure. She informed the Respondent that as per column No. 7 of the
terms and conditions, the possession of the flat was to be handed over after the
payment of all the four instalments.
1 0 . After much persuasion and fourteen years after taking of the loan from the
employer, the Respondent refunded the amount after deducting a sum of Rs. 3,937/-. In
this background, the complainant by her representation dated 29.12.2005 requested the
Respondent to refund the balance amount of Rs. 3,937/- with interest at the rate of
27% per annum for the deposit amount of Rs. 2,67,750/- from the dates mentioned
against each figure; i.e. from the date of payment of each respective instalment. She
also claimed compensation due to deficiency in service and negligence on the part of
the Respondent.
1 1 . In spite of the repeated requests, as the claim amount was not paid by the
Respondent, the complainant filed a complaint Under Section 12 of the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 before the Consumer Redressal Forum, Bangalore Urban District,
Bangalore with the following prayer:
(a) to refund Rs. 3,937/- towards the deposit lying with the Opposite Party and
to pay the interest at the rate of 27% p.a. from the dates mentioned against
each figure for the deposit amount of Rs. 2,67,750/-;
(b) to pay the cost of this proceedings;
(c) any other order or directions as deemed fit by this Hon'ble Forum in the
interest of justice and equity.
1 2 . The District Forum by its order dated 21st December, 2006 held that the
complainant had proved the deficiency of service on the part of the Respondent and
allowed the petition, directing the Respondent to pay an interest of 12% per annum on
Rs. 2,67,750/- from the date of its respective deposits till the date of realization with
further direction to refund an amount of Rs. 3937/- to the complainant.
1 3 . Being aggrieved, the complainant filed an Appeal No. 166/2007 before the
Karnataka State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission at Bangalore (to be referred
to as the ""State Commission"" for short). The complainant specifically pleaded that she
suffered losses, injury, harassment, mental agony and permanent loss of opportunity to
have her own flat as follows:
I. Loss of compound interest on the deposit of Rs. 2,67,750/-.
II. Loss of opportunity forever for taking housing loan from her employer since
housing loan is given only once in whole service period.
III. Loss of opportunity forever for taking housing loan from Finance Institute
because the Appellant has only about 7 years to retire, does not have property
that can be accepted by Financial Institutes as collateral security for the loan
and also does not have any friend who can stand as surety for the loan.
IV. Cost incurred in travelling from Delhi to Bangalore to pursue the allotment
of the flat in SFS scheme about 10 times.
V. Cost incurred in litigation.
1 4 . The State Commission on 6th February, 2007 by its short order dismissed the
appeal.
Aggrieved with the said order, the complainant moved the National Commission, but the
National Commission dismissed the Revision Petition with costs.
1 5 . The complainant appeared-in-person and claimed higher interest @ 27% and
compensation in lieu of deficiency in service. According to her, despite the concurrent
finding of deficiency in service of the Respondent, the compensation given is not in
accordance with the law laid down by this Court in different cases. Further according to
her, she suffered a loss as she deposited the money in the hope to get the flat but she
has been deprived of the benefit of escalation of the price of the flat, therefore, the
compensation in such cases should necessarily have been higher with higher interest, as
held by this Court in different cases.
16. According to learned Counsel for the Respondent, by notification dated 11h April,
1991, it was made clear by Housing Board that they reserved the right to design and
change specification. The original allotment of flat No. 116, Type-B under S.F. Scheme
at Kengeri, Satellite Town, Bangalore was provisional. It is accepted that the
complainant had deposited the instalments on time to the extent of Rs. 2,67,750/- out
of total cost of Rs. 3,15,000/- but according to the counsel for the Respondent the said
flat could not be constructed because of pending litigation in certain original suits. In
this background, the complainant was informed about the allotment of flat No. 64 for
R s . 5,90,000/- as provisional cost. By subsequent letter dated 15.2.1996, she was
informed that the SF scheme was converted into CH scheme.
17. It is further contended that vide letter dated 19.3.2005, the complainant wanted to
withdraw from the allotment and sought a refund of the amount paid with interest at the
rate of 27%. The Karnataka Housing Board, vide cheque dated 21.10.2005 refunded a
sum of Rs. 2,68,813/-, after deducting 25% of the registration fee i.e. 3,937.50. The
amount was debited from the account of Karnataka Housing Board on 8.11.2005. It is
denied that there was any deficiency in service on the part of the Respondent.
18. We have heard the learned Counsel for the parties and perused the record.
19. It is not in dispute that the complainant was allotted Flat No. 116, Type-B First
Floor at Kengeri under the Self Finance Scheme. She was informed by the Respondent
that the cost of the flat was Rs. 3,15,000/- and was asked to pay the cost along with
the registration fee in instalments. The complainant paid the instalment on time but the
Respondent neither delivered the possession of the flat to her nor offered any other flat
under the same scheme. The facts as narrated and noticed above were not disputed by
the Respondent before the District Forum, which after appreciating the evidence, came
to a definite opinion that 'the complainant had proved the deficiency in service on the
part of the Respondent'. In this background, the District Forum allowed the petition and
directed the Respondent to pay interest at the rate of 12% per annum on Rs. 2,67,750/-
to the complainant from the date of its respective deposits till the date of realization
with a further direction to refund the amount of Rs. 3,937/- to the complainant.
20. The aforesaid finding of the District Forum relating to deficiency in service on the
part of the Respondent was affirmed by the State Commission as well as by the National
Commission.
2 1 . Before the State Commission, the complainant took the specific plea of loss of
compound interest on the deposit of Rs. 2,67,750/-; loss of opportunity forever from
availing a housing loan, from her employer since it is given only once in the whole
service period and cost incurred in travelling from Delhi to Bangalore in pursuing the
allotment of the flat apart from the cost of litigation. In spite of the finding that the
complainant has proved the deficiency in service on the part of the Respondent, all the
Consumer Forums allowed only 12% interest and no amount was allowed towards
compensation.
22. The National Commission has been vested with jurisdiction Under Section 21 of the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which reads as follows:
21. Jurisdiction of the National Commission.-Subject to the other provisions of
this Act, the National Commission shall have jurisdiction-
(a) to entertain-
(i) complaints where the value of the goods or services and
compensation, if any, claimed exceeds [rupees one crore]; and
(ii)appeals against the orders of any State Commission; and
(b) to call for the records and pass appropriate orders in any consumer
dispute which is pending before or has been decided by any State
Commission where it appears to the National Commission that such
State Commission has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law,
or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or has acted in the
exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity.
From the aforesaid provision, it is clear that the National Commission can call for the
records and pass appropriate orders where it appears that the State Commission has
failed to exercise its jurisdiction so vested.
23. In the present case, the complainant succeeded in showing the deficiency of service
on the part of the Respondent which was also accepted by the State Commission. In
spite of such finding, no separate compensation was allowed in favour of the
complainant. Thereby though the State Commission failed to exercise its jurisdiction
and proceeded with material irregularity, the National Commission erred in holding that
the petition was not maintainable and wrongly imposed cost on the complainant.
2 4 . Similar case fell for compensation before this Court in Ghaziabad Development
Authority v. Balbir Singh MANU/SC/0282/2004 : (2004) 5 SCC 65. In the said case, the
question for consideration before this Court was whether grant of interest at the rate of
18% per annum by the Consumer Forums in all cases under consideration was
justifiable or not. While dealing with the matter the Court held:
8 . However, the power and duty to award compensation does not mean that
irrespective of facts of the case compensation can be awarded in all matters at
a uniform rate of 18% per annum. As seen above, what is being awarded is
compensation i.e. a recompense for the loss or injury. It therefore necessarily
has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and has to correlate with the
amount of loss or injury. Thus the Forum or the Commission must determine
that there has been deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office
which has resulted in loss or injury. No hard-and-fast Rule can be laid down,
however, a few examples would be where an allotment is made, price is
received/paid but possession is not given within the period set out in the
brochure. The Commission/Forum would then need to determine the loss. Loss
could be determined on basis of loss of rent which could have been earned if
possession was given and the premises let out or if the consumer has had to
stay in rented premises then on basis of rent actually paid by him. Along with
recompensing the loss the Commission/Forum may also compensate for
harassment/injury, both mental and physical. Similarly, compensation can be
given if after allotment is made there has been cancellation of scheme without
any justifiable cause.
In the said case the Court further proceeded and gave certain illustrations as to what
type of cases where in a higher interest amount can be paid apart from the
compensation and observed as follows:
9. That compensation cannot be uniform and can best be illustrated by
considering cases where possession is being directed to be delivered and cases
where only monies are directed to be returned. In cases where possession is
being directed to be delivered the compensation for harassment will necessarily
have to be less because in a way that party is being compensated by increase in
the value of the property he is getting. But in cases where monies are
being simply returned then the party is suffering a loss inasmuch as he
had deposited the money in the hope of getting a flat/plot. He is being
deprived of that flat/plot. He has been deprived of the benefit of
escalation of the price of that flat/plot. Therefore the compensation in
such cases would necessarily have to be higher. Further if the
construction is not of good quality or not complete, the compensation would be
the cost of putting it in good shape or completing it along with some
compensation for harassment. Similarly, if at the time of giving possession a
higher price or other amounts are collected unjustifiably and without there being
any provision for the same the direction would be to refund it with a reasonable
rate of interest. If possession is refused or not given because the consumer has
refused to pay the amount, then on the finding that the demand was unjustified
the consumer can be compensated for harassment and a direction to deliver
possession can be given. If a party who has paid the amount is told by the
authority that they are not in a position to ascertain whether he has paid the
amount and that party is made to run from pillar to post in order to show that
he has paid the amount, there would be deficiency of service for which
compensation for harassment must be awarded depending on the extent of
harassment. Similarly, if after delivery of possession, the sale deeds or title
deeds are not executed without any justifiable reasons, the compensation would
depend on the amount of harassment suffered. We clarify that the above are
mere examples. They are not exhaustive. The above shows that compensation
cannot be the same in all cases irrespective of the type of loss or injury suffered
by the consumer.
(Emphasis supplied)
25. The case of the complainant is covered by one of the examples cited by this Court
in Ghaziabad Development Authority v. Balbir Singh as quoted above. In this case also
the amount was simply returned and the complainant is suffering a loss inasmuch as
she had deposited the money in the hope of getting a flat but she is being deprived of
that flat and thereby deprived of the benefit of escalation of the price of that flat.
Therefore the compensation in this case would necessarily have to be higher, as per the
decision of this Court.
26. For the reasons aforesaid, we allow the appeals and pass the following order:
(i) The Respondent is directed to pay the Appellant-complainant interest at the
rate of 18% per annum on Rs. 2,67,750/- from date of its respective deposit till
the date of realization with further direction to refund the amount of Rs.
3,937/- to her, as directed by the Consumer Forum.
(ii) The Respondent is directed to pay the Appellant-complainant further sum of
Rs. 50,000/- as compensation for deficiency in service on their part.
(iii) The Respondent is also directed to pay the Appellant-complainant a sum of
Rs. 20,000/- towards cost of the litigation incurred by her.
The aforesaid amount be paid in favour of the Appellant-complainant on an early date
but not later than four weeks from the date of receipt/production of copy of this order.
The orders passed by the State Commission and the National Commission are set aside
and the order passed by the District Forum stands modified to the extent above.","Appellants: K.A. Nagamani

MATTERS RELATING TO CONSUMER PROTECTION - SLPs RELATING TO CONSUMER
PROTECTION
Facts:
The Complainant applied before the Housing Board for allotment of flat under
Self Financing Housing Scheme (""SF Scheme""). In response to the said
application, the Respondent allotted a flat under SFS scheme.
A certain amount was paid by her. The grievance of the complainant is that
though she was allotted flat after two and a half years of receipt of payment
of instalments, the said flat was not handed over to her. On the contrary, she
was informed that her allotment was changed and that she had been allotted
another flat in lieu of the previous allotment with different terms and
conditions. It is stated that the cost of the subsequent flat is much higher
than the cost of the earlier flat.
The complainant, thereafter, informed the Respondent that she was not in a
position to pay the higher amount and requested the allotment of the flat
which was earlier allotted to her. The Respondent informed that the flat
allotted to her could not be constructed due to the dispute raised by the land
owners and the matter was pending before the Court. The Respondent while
acknowledging the payment made by the complainant, informed that a further
cost was due from her.
As it was not possible for her to pay the additional sum demanded by the
Respondent, the complainant requested the Respondent to return the amount
as they had failed to keep their promise in spite of the receipt of the full
amount as per the payment structure.
After much persuasion the Respondent refunded the amount after deducting a
sum of Rs. 3,937/-. In this background, the complainant by her
representation requested the Respondent to refund the balance amount of Rs.
3,937/- with interest at the rate of 27% per annum for the deposit amount of
Rs. 2,67,750/- from the date of payment of each respective instalment. She
also claimed compensation due to deficiency in service and negligence on the
part of the Respondent.
In spite of the repeated requests, as the claim amount was not paid by the
Respondent, the complainant filed a complaint Under Section 12 of the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 before the Consumer Redressal Forum. The
District Forum by its order held that the complainant had proved the
deficiency of service on the part of the Respondent and allowed the petition,
directing the Respondent to pay an interest of 12% per annum on Rs.
2,67,750/- from the date of its respective deposits till the date of realization
with further direction to refund an amount of Rs. 3937/- to the complainant.
Being aggrieved, the complainant filed an Appeal before the Karnataka State
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission at Bangalore (""State Commission"").
The State Commission by its short order dismissed the appeal. Aggrieved, the
complainant moved the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,
New Delhi ('National Commission'), but the National Commission dismissed
the Revision Petition as non-maintainable. Hence, the present appeals.
Held, while allowing the appeals
1. In the present case, the complainant succeeded in showing the deficiency
of service on the part of the Respondent which was also accepted by the State
Commission. In spite of such finding, no separate compensation was allowed
in favour of the complainant. Thereby though the State Commission failed to
exercise its jurisdiction and proceeded with material irregularity, the National
Commission erred in holding that the petition was not maintainable and
wrongly imposed cost on the complainant.[23]
2. The case of the complainant is covered by one of the examples cited by this
Court in Ghaziabad Development Authority v. Balbir Singh. In this case also
the amount was simply returned and the complainant is suffering a loss
inasmuch as she had deposited the money in the hope of getting a flat but
she is being deprived of that flat and thereby deprived of the benefit of
escalation of the price of that flat. Therefore the compensation in this case
would necessarily have to be higher, as per the decision of this Court.[25]
3. For the reasons aforesaid, the Court allowed the appeals and passed the
following order:26
(i) The Respondent is directed to pay the Appellant-complainant interest at
the rate of 18% per annum on Rs. 2,67,750/- from date of its respective
deposit till the date of realization with further direction to refund the amount
of Rs. 3,937/- to her, as directed by the Consumer Forum.
(ii) The Respondent is directed to pay the Appellant-complainant further sum
of Rs. 50,000/- as compensation for deficiency in service on their part.
(iii) The Respondent is also directed to pay the Appellant-complainant a sum
of Rs. 20,000/- towards cost of the litigation incurred by her.
The aforesaid amount be paid in favour of the Appellant-complainant on an
early date but not later than four weeks from the date of receipt/production
of copy of this order. The orders passed by the State Commission and the
National Commission are set aside and the order passed by the District Forum
stands modified to the extent above.[26]",,,,
"1. Leave granted.
2 . This appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 26.11.2009
passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi
(hereinafter referred to as the 'Commission') constituted under the Consumer Protection
Act, 1986 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'), in Revision Petition No. 1156 of 2007,
MA. No. 291 of 2008; and MA. No. 450 of 2008, by way of which, the Commission has
dismissed the claim of the Appellant as well as the review petition seeking certain
reliefs.
3. The facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that:
A. The Appellant joined Health Department, of the Respondent State, as Medical
Officer on 5.6.1953 and took voluntary retirement on 28.10.1985. During the
period of service, he stood transferred to another district but he retained the
government accommodation, i.e. Bungalow No. B-8 from 11.5.1980 to
8.7.1981. Appellant claimed that he had not been paid all his retiral benefits,
and penal rent for the said period had also been deducted from his dues of
retiral benefits without giving any show cause notice to him.
B. Appellant made various representations, however, he was not granted any
relief by the State authorities.
C. Aggrieved, the Appellant preferred a complaint before the District Consumer
Disputes Redressal Forum, Faridabad (hereinafter referred to as the 'District
Forum') on 5.1.1995 and the said Forum vide order dated 24.3.2000 dismissed
the complaint on merits observing that his outstanding dues i.e. Pension,
gratuity and provident fund etc. Had correctly been calculated and paid to the
Appellant by the State authorities.
D. The Appellant approached the appellate authority, i.e., the State
Commission. The State Commission dismissed the appeal vide order dated
31.1.2007 observing that though the complaint was not maintainable as the
District Forum did not have jurisdiction to entertain the complaint of the
Appellant as he was not a ""consumer"" and the dispute between the parties
could not be redressed by the said Forum, but in view of the fact that the
opposite party (State) neither raised the issue of jurisdiction before the District
Forum nor preferred any appeal, order of the District Forum on the
jurisdictional issue attained finality. However, there was no merit in the appeal.
E. Aggrieved, the Appellant filed Revision Petition No. 1156 of 2007 before the
Commission. The said revision stood dismissed vide order dated 1.4.2008 and
the review filed by the Appellant has also been dismissed vide order dated
26.11.2009.
Hence, this appeal.
4. Shri Narendra Hooda, learned Senior AAG, Haryana, has raised preliminary issue of
the jurisdiction submitting that the service matter of a government servant cannot be
dealt with by any of the Forum in any hierarchy under the Act. Therefore, the matter
should not be considered on merit at all. More so, all the outstanding dues of the
Appellant had been paid, and none of the issues survive any more.
5. Shri Prateesh Kapur, learned Amicus Curiae, has raised a large number of grievances,
inter-alia, that till today the Appellant has not been paid all his retiral benefits as some
of his outstanding dues have been withheld by the authorities, thus, he is entitled to
recover the same with interest; whether the Forum was competent to entertain the
complaint ought to have been decided by the District Forum first as a preliminary issue.
It is difficult for a litigant to go back to any other appropriate Forum after such a long
time. In the instant case, the Appellant approached the District Forum in 1995, the
matter could not be finalised till date, and at such a belated stage, the Appellant if
asked to approach the other forum, a great hardship would be caused to him.
6 . We have considered the rival submissions made by learned Counsel for the parties
and perused the records.
7 . Indisputably, it is a settled legal proposition that conferment of jurisdiction is a
legislative function and it can neither be conferred with the consent of the parties nor
by a superior Court, and if the Court passes a decree having no jurisdiction over the
matter, it would amount to nullity as the matter goes to the roots of the cause. Such an
issue can be raised at any stage of the proceedings. The finding of a Court or Tribunal
becomes irrelevant and unenforceable/in executable once the forum is found to have no
jurisdiction. Similarly, if a Court/Tribunal inherently lacks jurisdiction, acquiescence of
party equally should not be permitted to perpetuate and perpetrate, defeating the
legislative animation. The Court cannot derive jurisdiction apart from the Statute. In
such eventuality the doctrine of waiver also does not apply. (Vide: United Commercial
Bank Ltd. v. Their Workmen MANU/SC/0067/1951 : AIR 1951 SC 230;S mt. Nai

Bhaiyalal MANU/SC/0328/1973 : AIR 1973 SC 2391 held, that a decree without
jurisdiction is a nullity. It is a coram non judice; when a special statute gives a right
and also provides for a forum for adjudication of rights, remedy has to be sought only
under the provisions of that Act and the Common Law Court has no jurisdiction; where
an Act creates an obligation and enforces the performance in specified manner,
""performance cannot be forced in any other manner.""
9. Law does not permit any court/tribunal/authority/forum to usurp jurisdiction on any
ground whatsoever, in case, such a authority does not have jurisdiction on the subject
matter. For the reason that it is not an objection as to the place of suing;, ""it is an
objection going to the nullity of the order on the ground of want of jurisdiction"". Thus,
for assumption of jurisdiction by a court or a tribunal, existence of jurisdictional fact is
a condition precedent. But once such jurisdictional fact is found to exist, the court or
tribunal has power to decide on the adjudicatory facts or facts in issue. (Vide:

10. The Act was enacted to provide for the better protection of interest of consumers,
such as the right to be protected against marketing of goods which are hazardous to life
and property; the right to be informed about the quality, quantity, potency, purity,
standard and price of goods, to protect the consumer against unfair trade practices; and
right to seek redressal against an unscrupulous exploitation of consumers, and further
to provide right to consumer education etc. As is evident from the statement of objects
and reasons of the Act.
11. Section 2 of the Act which is a definition clause defines the following as under:
2(b) 'Complainant' means-
(i) a consumer; or
(ii) any voluntary consumer association registered under the
Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), or under any other law for the time
being in force; or
(iii) the Central Government or any State Government;
(iv) one or more consumers, where there are numerous consumers
having the same interest;
(v) in case of death of a consumer, his legal heir or representative;
who or which makes a complaint;
2(c) 'complaint' means any allegation in writing made by a complainant that-
(i) an unfair trade practice or a restrictive trade practice has been
adopted by any trader or service provider;
(ii) the goods bought by him or agreed to be bought by him suffer from
one or more defects;
(iii) the services hired or availed of or agreed to be hired or availed of
by him suffer from deficiency in any respect;
xxx xxx xxx
2(d) 'consumer' means any person who-
(i) buys any goods for a consideration which has been paid or
promised or partly paid and partly promised, or under any system of
deferred payment and includes any user of such goods other than the
person who buys such goods for consideration paid or promised or
partly paid or partly promised, or under any system of deferred
payment when such use is made with the approval of such person, but
does not include a person who obtains such goods for resale or for any
commercial purpose; or
(ii) [hires or avails of] any services for a consideration which has been
paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised, or under any
system of deferred payment and includes any beneficiary of such
services other than the person who [hires or avails of] the services for
consideration paid or promised, or partly paid and partly promised, or
under any system of deferred payments, when such services are availed
of with the approval of the first-mentioned person; [but does not
include a person who avails of such services for any commercial
purpose;
xxx xxx xxx
2(g) 'deficiency' means any fault, imperfection, shortcoming or inadequacy in
the quality, nature and manner of performance which is required to be
maintained by or under any law for the time being in force or has been
undertaken to be performed by a person in pursuance of a contract or otherwise
in relation to any service;
2(o) 'service' means service of any description which is made available to
potential users and includes, but not limited to, the provision of facilities in
connection with banking, financing, insurance, transport, processing, supply of
electrical or other energy, board or lodging or both, [housing construction],
entertainment, amusement or the purveying of news or other information, but
does not include the rendering of any service free of charge or under a contract
of personal service.
Section 11 of the Act deals with the jurisdiction of the District Forum as:
(1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the District Forum shall have
jurisdiction to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services
and the compensation, if any, claimed [does not exceed rupees twenty lakhs.
The aforesaid statutory provisions make it crystal clear that the Act is made to deal with
the rights of consumers wherein marketing of goods, or ""services"" as defined under the
Act have been provided. Therefore, the question does arise as to whether the Forum
under the Act can deal with the service matters of government servants.
12. In Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund v. Kartick Das MANU/SC/0553/1994 : (1994)
4 SCC 225, this Court examined the issue as to whether a prospective buyer can be
""consumer"" under the Act, and held:
The consumer as the term implies is one who consumes. As per the definition,
consumer is the one who purchases goods for private use or consumption. The
meaning of the word 'consumer' is broadly stated in the above definition so as
to include anyone who consumes goods or services at the end of the chain of
production. The comprehensive definition aims at covering every man who pays
money as the price or cost of goods and services. The consumer deserves to get
what he pays for in real quantity and true quality. In every society, consumer
remains the centre of gravity of all business and industrial activity. He needs
protection from the manufacturer, producer, supplier, wholesaler and retailer.
xxx xxx xxx
Therefore, it is after allotment, rights may arise as per the contract (Article of Association
of Company). But certainly not before allotment. At that stage, he is only a prospective
investor (sic in) future goods....There is no purchase of goods for a consideration nor
again could he be called the hirer of the services of the company for a consideration. In
order to satisfy the requirement of above definition of consumer, it is clear that there
must be a transaction of buying goods for consideration under Section 2(1)(d)(i) of the
said Act. The definition contemplates the pre-existence of a completed transaction of a
sale and purchase. If regard is had to the definition of complaint under the Act, it will be
clear that no prospective investor could fall under the Act.
1 3 . I n Secretary, Board of Secondary Education, Orissa v. Santosh Kumar
Sahoo and Anr. MANU/SC/0444/2010 : AIR 2010 SC 3553, this Court resolved the
issue as to whether the Forum under the Act had jurisdiction to entertain and allow a
complaint filed by a person for correction of his date of birth recorded in the
matriculation certificate, observing that the impugned order was liable to be set aside
because all the consumer forums failed to consider the issue of maintainability of the
complaint in a correct perspective. Before the District Forum could go into the issue of
correctness of the date of birth recorded in the matriculation certificate of Respondent
1, it ought to have considered whether the so-called failure of the Appellant to make
correction in terms of the prayer made by Respondent 1 amounted to deficiency of
service.
The court remitted the matter to the District Forum to decide the issue of maintainability
of the complaint.
1 4 . This Court in Bihar School Examination Board v. Suresh Prasad Sinha
MANU/SC/1605/2009 : AIR 2010 SC 93, considered the question as to whether a
candidate can file a complaint before the District Forum under the Act raising any
grievance regarding his examinations conducted by the Bihar School Examinations
Board constituted under the Bihar School Examinations Board Act, 1952 and answered it
in negative observing as under:
The object of the Act is to cover in its net, services offered or rendered for a
consideration. Any service rendered for a consideration is presumed to be a
commercial activity in its broadest sense (including professional activity or
quasi-commercial activity). But the Act does not intend to cover discharge of a
statutory function of examining whether a candidate is fit to be declared as
having successfully completed a course by passing the examination. The fact
that in the course of conduct of the examination, or evaluation of answer
scripts, or furnishing of mark sheets or certificates, there may be some
negligence, omission or deficiency, does not convert the Board into a service
provider for a consideration, nor convert the examinee into a consumer who can
make a complaint under the Act. We are clearly of the view that the Board is not
a 'service provider' and a student who takes an examination is not a 'consumer'
and consequently, complaint under the Act will not be maintainable against the
Board.
(See also: Maharshi Dayanand University v. Surjeet Kaur MANU/SC/0485/2010 :
(2010) 11 SCC 159).
15. In Regional Provident Fund Commissioner v. Bhavani MANU/SC/2084/2008 :
AIR 2008 SC 2957, this Court dealt with the issue as to whether Dr. Padia's submissions
regarding the non-applicability of the Act to the case of the Regional Provident Fund
Commissioner-the person responsible for the working of a Pension Scheme, could be
held to be a 'service giver' within the meaning of Section 2(1)(o) of the Act, as it was
neither a case of rendering of free service nor rendering of service under a contract of
personal service so as to bring the relationship between the parties within the concept
of 'master and servant'. The court held:
In our view, the Respondent comes squarely within the definition of 'consumer'
within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d)(ii), inasmuch as, by becoming a member
of the Employees' Family Pension Scheme, 1971, and contributing to the same,
she was availing of the services rendered by the Appellant for implementation of
the Scheme. The same is the case in the other appeals as well.
16. In view of the above, it is evident that by no stretch of imagination a government
servant can raise any dispute regarding his service conditions or for payment of gratuity
or GPF or any of his retiral benefits before any of the Forum under the Act. The
government servant does not fall under the definition of a ""consumer"" as defined under
Section 2(1)(d)(ii) of the Act. Such government servant is entitled to claim his retiral
benefits strictly in accordance with his service conditions and Regulations or statutory
rules framed for that purpose. The appropriate forum, for redressal of any his
grievance, may be the State Administrative Tribunal, if any, or Civil Court but certainly
not a Forum under the Act.
17. In view of the above, we hold that the government servant cannot approach any of
the Forum under the Act for any of the retiral benefits.
18. Mr. Hooda has made a statement that all the dues for which the Appellant had been
entitled to had already been paid and the penal rent has also been dispensed with and
the State is not going to charge any penal rent. If the State has already charged the
penal rent, it will be refunded to the Appellant within a period of two months. In view
thereof, we do not want to pass any further order.
In view of the above, the appeal stands disposed of. Before parting with the case, we
record our appreciation for the assistance rendered by Shri Prateesh Kapur, learned
Amicus Curiae. He is entitled for full fees as per the Rules.","Appellants: Jagmittar Sain Bhagat

MATTERS RELATING TO CONSUMER PROTECTION - SLPs RELATING TO CONSUMER
PROTECTION
By no stretch of imagination a Government servant can raise any dispute
regarding his service conditions or for payment of gratuity or G.P.F. or any of
his retiral benefits before any of the Forum under the Consumer Protection
Act. The Government servant does not fall under the definition of a
""consumer"" as defined under Section 2(1)(d)(ii) of the Consumer Protection
Act. Such Government servant is entitled to claim his retiral benefits strictly
in accordance with his service conditions and regulations or statutory rules
framed for that purpose. The appropriate forum, for redressal of any his
grievance, may be the State Administrative Tribunal, if any, or civil court but
certainly not a Forum under the Consumer Protection Act.
The Government servant cannot approach any of the Forum under the
Consumer Act for any of the retiral benefits.
(2) Consumer Protection - Objects and reasons of Consumer Protection Act,
1986--Stated.
The Consumer Protection Act was enacted to provide for the better protection
of interest of consumers, such as the right to be protected against marketing
of goods which are hazardous to life and property; the right to be informed
about the quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard and price of goods, to
protect the consumer against unfair trade practices; and right to seek
redressal against an unscrupulous exploitation of consumers, and further to
provide right to consumer education etc. as is evident from the statement of
objects and reasons of the Consumer Protection Act.
(3) Jurisdiction - Conferment of jurisdiction--Is legislative function--It can
neither be conferred with consent of parties nor by Superior Court--Court
cannot derive jurisdiction apart from statute.
Indisputably, it is a settled legal proposition that conferment of jurisdiction is
a legislative function and it can neither be conferred with the consent of the
parties nor by a superior Court, and if the Court passes a decree having no
jurisdiction over the matter, it would amount to nullity as the matter goes to
the roots of the cause. Such an issue can be raised at any stage of the
proceedings. The finding of a Court or Tribunal becomes irrelevant and
unenforceable/inexecutable once the forum is found to have no jurisdiction.
Similarly, if a Court/Tribunal inherently lacks jurisdiction, acquiescence of
party equally should not be permitted to perpetuate and perpetrate, defeating
the legislative animation. The Court cannot derive jurisdiction apart from the
Statute. In such eventuality the doctrine of waiver also does not apply.
Law does not permit any Court/Tribunal/Authority/Forum to usurp
jurisdiction on any ground whatsoever, in case, such a authority does not
have jurisdiction on the subject-matter. For the reason that it is not an
objection as to the place of suing; ""it is an objection going to the nullity of
the order on the ground of want of jurisdiction"". Thus, for assumption of
jurisdiction by a Court or a Tribunal, existence of jurisdictional fact is a
condition precedent. But once such jurisdictional fact is found to exist, the
Court or Tribunal has power to decide on the adjudicatory facts or facts in
issue.",,,,

1. All the above-mentioned appeals have been preferred against the common impugned
judgment and order dated 18.2.2003 passed by the National Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission, New Delhi, in Revision Petition Nos. 662, 663, 664, 665, 666,
667, 668, 669, 670, 671, 672, 673, 674, 933 of 2002 and 238, 246 and 247 of 2001.
2. Facts and circumstances giving rise to these appeals are that:
A. The Appellant herein, Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd.,
(hereinafter referred to as 'the insurer'), is a government company, which is in
the business of insuring exporters. Respondent, M/s. Garg Sons International,
on 23.3.1995 purchased a policy for the purpose of insuring a shipment to
foreign buyers i.e. M/s. Natural Selection Company Ltd. of UK, and the said
buyer committed default in making payments towards such policy from
28.12.1995 onwards, with respect to the said consignment.
B. The insured, that is M/s. Garg Sons International, sought enhancement of
credit limit to the tune of Rs. 50 lakhs with respect to the said defaulting
foreign importer. Subsequently, he presented 17 claims.
C. The insurer rejected all the abovementioned claims on the ground that the
insured did not ensure compliance with Clause 8(b) of the insurance
agreement, which stipulated the period within which the insurer is to be
informed about any default committed by a foreign importer.
D. Thus, the insured then filed several complaints before the State Disputes
Redressal Commission, to which the insurer filed replies. The State Disputes
Redressal Commission adjudicated upon the case and disposed of the said
complaint, vide order dated 4.6.2001, directing the insurer to make various
requisite payments due under different claims, with 9 per cent interest and
litigation expenses etc.
E. Being aggrieved against the orders passed in all 17 claims, the insurer
preferred appeals under Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986,
before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, wherein the
impugned judgment and order was disputed, stating that it was evident from
the said judgment that 11 claims had been rejected and that 5 claims made by
the insured were accepted.
Hence, both the parties preferred these appeals.
3. Shri Santosh Paul, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the insurer, has submitted
that the insured failed to communicate information pertaining to the default made by
the foreign importer, to the insurer, within the stipulated period, which was fixed as 45
days from the date on which the payment became due, and thus, failed to ensure
compliance with the mandatory requirement under Clause 8(b), owing to which, the
claims with respect to which the said information was not furnished within the time
period stipulated in the agreement, have wrongly been allowed. Moreover, it is evident
from the judgment that only 5 claims made by the insured were accepted, and that 11
claims were rejected, though in the said order, only 9 claims were found to be rejected
and 4 were shown as accepted. As the only numbers of 4 revisions have been
mentioned, stating that only these were worth acceptance, and those of 9 revisions have
been mentioned, as those that were rejected, which was all stated to show that there
were typographical errors in the judgment itself.
In addition thereto, there were also certain appeals and thus, the order was required to
be modified to the extent that only two claims which were made in respect of Civil
Appeal Nos. 1547 of 2004 and 1557 of 2004, wherein all statutory requirements were
complied with deserve to be allowed, while the others, owing to default on the part of
the insured, are liable to be rejected.
4. On the other hand, Shri Satinder Singh Gulati, learned Counsel appearing on behalf
of the insured, has submitted that admittedly, there is in fact a typographical error in
the impugned judgment and order, and has stated that the claims of the insured, with
respect to which there has been no default on the part of insured, i.e., some claims
have wrongly been rejected. Therefore, the appeals filed by him i.e. Civil Appeal Nos.
1559, 1544, 1545, 1543 and 1546 of 2004 should be allowed and the other appeals,
should be rejected accordingly.
5 . We have considered the rival submissions made by learned Counsel for the parties
and perused the record.
6. Relevant clauses of the insurance policy dated 23.3.1995, read as under:
8. Declarations:
(a) Declaration of shipments:....
(b) Declaration of overdue payments: The insured shall also deliver
to the Corporation, on or before the 15th of every month, declaration in
the term prescribed by the Corporation, of all payments which
remained wholly or partly unpaid for more than 30 days from the due
date of payment in respect of shipments made within the policy period
and such declaration shall continue to be rendered to the Corporation
even after the expiry of the policy period so long as any such payment
remains overdue.
Xx xx xx
19. Exclusion of Liability: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this policy, unless otherwise agreed to by the Corporation
in writing, the Corporation shall cease to have any liability in respect of
the gross invoice value of any shipment or part thereof, if:
(a) the insured has failed to declare, without any omission, all
the shipments required to be declared in terms of Clause 8(a)
of the policy and to pay premium in terms of Clause 10 of the
policy;
(b) the insured has failed to submit declaration of overdue
payments as required by Clause 8(b) of the policy; or
(c) ...
7. If both the conditions referred to hereinabove are read together, it becomes evident
that the insured must make a declaration in the prescribed form (Form No. 205), on the
15th of every month as regards whether or not, there has been any default committed
by the foreign importer, either in part, or in full, for a period exceeding 30 days from
the date on which the payment fell due, with respect to shipments made within the
policy period. Non-compliance with the said term(s) of contract, will exonerate the
insurer of all liability in this regard.
8 . It is a settled legal proposition that while construing the terms of a contract of
insurance, the words used therein must be given paramount importance, and it is not
open for the Court to add, delete or substitute any words. It is also well settled, that
since upon issuance of an insurance policy, the insurer undertakes to indemnify the loss
suffered by the insured on account of risks covered by the policy, its terms have to be
strictly construed in order to determine the extent of the liability of the insurer.
Therefore, the endeavour of the Court should always be to interpret the words used in
the contract in the manner that will best express the intention of the parties. (Vide:
Suraj Mal Ram Niwas Oil Mills (P) Ltd. v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd.,
MANU/SC/0814/2010 : (2010) 10 SCC 567).
9 . The insured cannot claim anything more than what is covered by the insurance
policy. ""...the terms of the contract have to be construed strictly, without altering the
nature of the contract as the same may affect the interests of the parties adversely."" The
clauses of an insurance policy have to be read as they are... Consequently, the terms of
the insurance policy, that fix the responsibility of the Insurance Company must also be
read strictly. The contract must be read as a whole and every attempt should be made
to harmonize the terms thereof, keeping in mind that the rule of contra proferentem
does not apply in case of commercial contract, for the reason that a clause in a
commercial contract is bilateral and has mutually been agreed upon.
(Vide: Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Sony Cheriyan MANU/SC/0495/1999 : AIR
1999 SC 3252; Polymat India P. Ltd. v. National Insurance Co. Ltd.
MANU/SC/1019/2004 : AIR 2005 SC 286;S umitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. v. Oil
and Natural Gas Co. MANU/SC/0540/2010 : AIR 2010 SC 3400; andR ashtriya Ispat
Nigam Ltd. v. Dewan Chand Ram Saran MANU/SC/0327/2012 : AIR 2012 SC 2829).
10. In Vikram Greentech (I) Ltd. and Anr. v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd.
MANU/SC/0519/2009 : AIR 2009 SC 2493, it was held:
An insurance contract, is a species of commercial transactions and must be
construed like any other contract to its own terms and by itself....
The Endeavour of the court must always be to interpret the words in which the contract
is expressed by the parties. The court while construing the terms of policy is not
expected to venture into extra liberalism that may result in rewriting the contract or
substituting the terms which were not intended by the parties.
(See also: Sikka Papers Limited v. National Insurance Co. Ltd and Ors.
MANU/SC/0907/2009 : AIR 2009 SC 2834).
11. Thus, it is not permissible for the court to substitute the terms of the contract itself,
under the garb of construing terms incorporated in the agreement of insurance. No
exceptions can be made on the ground of equity. The liberal attitude adopted by the
court, by way of which it interferes in the terms of an insurance agreement, is not
permitted. The same must certainly not be extended to the extent of substituting words
that were never intended to form a part of the agreement.
12. The instant case is required to be considered in light of the aforesaid settled legal
propositions. The requisite record reveals the factual matrix as under:
13. The aforesaid chart clearly establishes that the insured failed to comply with the
requirement of Clause 8(b) of the agreement informing the insurer about the nonpayment
of outstanding dues by the foreign importer within the stipulated time except
in two cases.
14. Thus, we are of the view that only two claims which are subject-matters in Civil
Appeal Nos. 1547 and 1557 of 2004 deserve to be allowed. The others are disallowed.
With these observations, all 17 appeals stand disposed of.","Appellants: Export Credit Guarantee Corpn. of India Ltd.

MATTERS RELATING TO CONSUMER PROTECTION - SLPs RELATING TO CONSUMER
PROTECTION",,,,
"Indu Malhotra, J.
1 . The present statutory Appeals have been filed Under Section 23 of the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 to challenge the Final judgment and Order dated 23.10.2018
passed in Consumer Case No. 238 of 2017 and Consumer Case No. 239 of 2017 by the
National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as ""the
National Commission"").
2. Since a common issue arises in both the Civil Appeals, they are being disposed of by
the present common judgment and Order.
3 . For the sake of brevity, the facts in C.A. No. 12238 of 2018 are being referred to,
being the lead matter.
The factual matrix of the said Civil Appeal is as under:
3.1. The Appellant-Builder launched a residential project by the name ""Araya
Complex"" in Sector 62, Golf Course Extension Road, Gurugram.
The Respondent-Flat Purchaser entered into an Apartment Buyer's Agreement
dated 08.05.2012 with the Appellant-Builder to purchase an apartment in the
said project for a total sale consideration of Rs. 4,83,25,280/-. As per Clause
11.2 of the Agreement, the Appellant-Builder was to make all efforts to apply
for the Occupancy Certificate within 39 months from the date of excavation,
with a grace period of 180 days.
3.2. The excavation of the project commenced on 04.06.2012. As per Clause
11.2 of the Agreement, the Builder was required to apply for the Occupancy
Certificate by 04.09.2015, or within a further grace period of 6 months i.e. by
04.03.2016, and offer possession of the flat to the Respondent-Flat Purchaser.
The Appellant-Builder however failed to apply for the Occupancy Certificate as
per the stipulations in the Agreement.
3.3. The Respondent-Flat Purchaser filed a Consumer Complaint before the
National Commission on 27.01.2017 alleging deficiency of service on the part
of the Appellant-Builder for failure to obtain the Occupancy Certificate, and
hand over possession of the flat.
The Respondent prayed inter-alia for:
• Refund of the entire amount deposited being Rs. 4,48,43,026/-, along
with Interest @18% p.a.; and
• Compensation Rs. 10,00,000/- for mental agony, harassment,
discomfort and undue hardship; and
• Refund of the wrongfully charged taxes including Service Tax, and
other charges along with Interest @18% p.a.; and
• Litigation Costs of Rs. 1,00,000/-.
3.4. On 06.02.2017, the National Commission passed an ex-parte Interim Order
restraining the Appellant-Builder from cancelling the allotment made in favour
of the Respondent-Flat Purchaser during the pendency of the Consumer Case.
3.5. During the pendency of the proceedings before the National Commission,
the Appellant-Builder obtained the Occupancy Certificate on 23.07.2018, and
issued a Possession Letter to the Respondent-Flat Purchaser on 28.08.2018.
3.6. The Appellant-Builder submitted before the National Commission that since
the construction of the apartment was complete, and the Occupancy Certificate
had since been obtained, the Respondent-Flat Purchaser must be directed to
take possession of the apartment, instead of directing refund of the amount
deposited.
3.7. The Respondent-Flat Purchaser however submitted that he was not
interested in taking possession of the apartment on account of the inordinate
delay of almost 3 years. The Respondent-Flat Purchaser stated that he had, in
the meanwhile, taken an alternate property in Gurugram, and sought refund of
the entire amount of Rs. 4,48,43,026/- deposited by him along with Interest
@18% p.a.
3.8. The National Commission vide Final judgment and Order dated 23.10.2018
allowed the Consumer Complaint filed by the Respondent-Flat Purchaser, and
held that since the last date stipulated for construction had expired about 3
years before the Occupancy Certificate was obtained, the Respondent-Flat
Purchaser could not be compelled to take possession at such a belated stage.
The grounds urged by the Appellant-Builder for delay in handing over
possession were not justified, so as to deny awarding compensation to the
Respondent-Flat Purchaser. The clauses in the Agreement were held to be
wholly one-sided, unfair, and not binding on the Respondent-Flat Purchaser.
The Appellant-Builder was directed to refund Rs. 4,48,43,026/- i.e. the amount
deposited by the Respondent-Flat Purchaser, along with Interest @10.7% S.I.
p.a. towards compensation. The rate of Interest @10.7% S.I. p.a. was fixed in
accordance with Rule 15 of the Haryana Real Estate (Regulation and
Development) Rules, 2017 which reads as follows:
15. An allottee shall be compensated by the promoter for loss or
damage sustained due to incorrect or false statement in the notice,
advertisement, prospectus or brochure in the terms of Section 12. In
case, allottee wishes to withdraw from the project due to discontinuance
of promoter's business as developers on account of suspension or
revocation of the registration or any other reason(s) in terms of Clause
(b) Sub-section (I) of Section 18 or the promoter fails to give
possession of the apartment/plot in accordance with terms and
conditions of agreement for sale in terms of Sub-section (4) of Section
19. The promoter shall return the entire amount with interest as well as
the compensation payable. The rate of interest payable by the promoter
to the allottee or by the allottee to the promoter, as the case may be,
shall be the State Bank of India highest marginal cost of lending rate
plus two percent. ....
However, for the period when the Interim Order dated 06.02.2017 was in
operation, which restrained the Appellant-Builder from cancelling the
Respondent's allotment, no Interest was awarded. The National Commission
ordered payment of Interest from the date of each installment till 05.02.2017;
and from the date of the Order passed by the Commission till the date on which
the amount would be refunded.
3.9. Aggrieved by the Order dated 23.10.2018 passed by the National
Commission, the Appellant-Builder preferred the present statutory Appeal Under
Section 23 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
4. Mr. C.A. Sundaram, Senior Counsel appeared for the Appellant-Builder, and drew our
attention to the following Clauses in the Apartment Buyer's Agreement dated
08.05.2012 viz. Clause 11.5 (ii), (iv) and (v) along with Clause 20 which read as under:
11.5. (ii) In the event of further delay by the Developer in handing over of the
possession of the Unit even after 12 months from the end of grace period, then
in such case, the intending Allottee shall have an additional option to terminate
this Agreement by giving termination notice of 90 days to the Developer and
refund of the actual installment paid by him against the Unit after adjusting the
taxes paid/interest/penalty on delayed payments.
...
(iv) Developer shall, within ninety (90) days from the date of receipt of
termination notice of said Unit, refund to the intending Allottee, all the monies
received excluding the service tax collected on various remittances, till the date
of the refund, from the Intending Allottee under this Agreement. In case the
Developer fails to refund the Sale Price, the Developer shall pay interest to the
Intending Allottee @ 9% per annum for any period beyond the said period of
ninety (90) days. The Intending Allottee shall have no other claim against the
Developer in respect of the said Unit along with the parking space. The
Intending Allottee in this event shall have no right to seek any compensation
apart from the interest as stipulated herein.
...
(v) If the Intending Allottee fails to exercise his right of termination within the
time limit as aforesaid, by delivery to the Developer of a written notice
acknowledged by the Developer in this regard, then he shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement thereafter and he shall continue to be bound by the
provisions of this Agreement, provided that in such case, the Developer shall
continue to pay the compensation provided herein.
20. RIGHT OF CANCELLATION BY THE ALLOTTEE
Except to the extent specifically and expressly stated elsewhere in this
Agreement, the Intending Allottee shall have the right to cancel this Agreement
solely in the event of the clear and unambiguous failure of the warranties of the
Developer that leads to frustration of the contract on that account. In such case,
the Allottee shall be entitled to a refund of the installments actually paid by it
along with interest thereon @ 6% per annum, within a period of 90 days from
the date of communication to the Developer in this regard less any payments
made towards taxes paid by the Developer or interest paid due or payable, any
other amount of a non-refundable nature. No other claim, whatsoever, monetary
or otherwise shall lie against the Developer nor shall be raised otherwise or in
any manner whatsoever by the Allottee. Save and except to this limited extent,
the Allottee shall not have any right to cancel this Agreement on any ground
whatsoever.
4.1. It was submitted that the Respondent-Flat Purchaser was not entitled to refund of
the amount deposited, since the Apartment Buyer's Agreement was not terminated by
the Respondent-Flat Purchaser in accordance with Clause 11.5 (ii) of the Agreement,
which stipulates that the allottee has to terminate the Agreement by giving a
Termination Notice of 90 days to the Developer.
Since the Respondent-Flat Purchaser had not terminated the Agreement by a written
notice as per Clause 11.5, the Builder could not sell the apartment, and refund the
money to the Respondent-Flat Purchaser. On the contrary, the Respondent filed a
Consumer Complaint and obtained an ex-parte Interim Order dated 06.02.2017
restraining the Builder from cancelling the allotment made in favour of the Respondent.
4.2. It was further submitted that if the filing of the Consumer Complaint is considered
as an act of termination of the Agreement, then the same was premature. As per Clause
11.5 (ii), the Respondent-Flat Purchaser could have claimed refund only after the expiry
of 12 months after the grace period came to an end i.e. after 04.03.2017. However, the
Consumer Complaint was filed on 27.01.2017. In these circumstances, even if it is
found that the Appellant-Builder is liable to refund the amount deposited with Interest,
then the date of the Impugned Order i.e. 23.10.2018, must be treated as the date of
serving the Termination Notice as per Clause 11.5 (ii) of the Agreement, and the
Appellant-Builder should be held liable to pay Interest only after 90 days from the date
of termination i.e. from 23.01.2019.
4.3. With respect to rate of Interest awarded by the National Commission, it was
submitted that the Commission erred in granting Interest @10.7% S.I. p.a. even though
Clause 20 of the Agreement provided Interest @6% p.a. in case of delay in handing
over possession. Even under Clause 11.5 of the Agreement, the Builder was liable to
pay Interest @9% p.a., but not @10.7% S.I. p.a. The learned Senior Counsel relied
upon this Court's judgment in Bharathi Knitting Co. v. DHL Worldwide Express Courier
Division of Airfreight Ltd., MANU/SC/0628/1996 : (1996) 4 SCC 704 and submitted that
the National Commission could not have granted compensation in excess of the rate
prescribed by the Agreement.
5. Mr. Sushil Kaushik, learned Counsel represented the Respondent-Flat Purchaser.
5.1. It was submitted that the filing of the Consumer Complaint may be treated as his
Termination Notice under Clause 11.5 (ii) of the Agreement. Under the Agreement, the
Builder was obligated to apply for the Occupancy Certificate within 39 months from the
date of excavation, with a grace period of further 6 months. The period got over by
04.03.3016 after taking into account the grace period.
Admittedly, the Appellant-Builder offered possession after an inordinate delay of almost
3 years on 28.08.2018. On account of the inordinate delay, the Respondent-Flat
Purchaser had no option but to arrange for alternate accommodation in Gurugram.
Hence, he could not be compelled to take possession of the apartment after such a long
delay.
It was in these circumstances that the Respondent-Flat Purchaser sought stay of the
cancellation of the allotment as a collateral, till his claim for refund was adjudicated by
the National Commission.
5.2. It was further submitted that the Clauses of the Agreement were one-sided. As per
Clause 6.4 (ii) of the Apartment Buyer's Agreement, the Appellant Builder could charge
Interest @18% p.a. for delayed payments.
However, the Appellant-Builder was not required to pay equivalent Interest to the
Respondent-Flat Purchaser for delay in handing over possession of the flat.
On the contrary, as per Clause 11.5 (iv) of the Agreement, in case of delay on the part
of the Appellant-Builder in handing over possession of the flat, the Respondent-Flat
Purchaser was entitled to Interest @9% p.a. only.
5.3. The Respondent further submitted that the National Commission had ordered
payment of Interest as per the statutory Rules i.e. Rule 15 of the Haryana Real Estate
(Regulation and Development) Rules, 2017 @10.7% S.I. p.a.
The Respondent-Flat Purchaser submitted that he had obtained a loan for Rs.
3,30,00,000/- from Standard Chartered Bank to purchase the flat in question, and had
entered into a Tripartite Loan Agreement with the Bank and the Builder. The
Respondent-Flat Purchaser had to pay Interest @10% p.a. for servicing the loan for the
entire period. Hence, Interest @10.7% S.I. p.a. awarded by the National Commission
was just and fair.
It was pointed out that even though the National Commission had not granted Interest
for the period during which the Order of stay of cancellation of the allotment was in
operation, the Respondent-Flat Purchaser had to pay Interest to the Bank even for this
period.
5.4. The Respondent-Flat Purchaser submitted that the present Appeal be dismissed,
and the Builder be directed to pay the amount awarded by the National Commission
with Interest, within 1 week, so that the Respondent can discharge his loan liability.
6. We have heard the learned Counsel for both the parties, and perused the pleadings,
and written submissions filed.
6.1. In the present case, admittedly the Appellant-Builder obtained the Occupancy
Certificate almost 2 years after the date stipulated in the Apartment Buyer's Agreement.
As a consequence, there was a failure to hand over possession of the flat to the
Respondent-Flat Purchaser within a reasonable period. The Occupancy Certificate was
obtained after a delay of more than 2 years on 28.08.2018 during the pendency of the
proceedings before the National Commission.
In Lucknow Development Authority v. M.K. Gupta, MANU/SC/0178/1994 : (1994) 1 SCC
243 this Court held that when a person hires the services of a builder, or a contractor,
for the construction of a house or a flat, and the same is for a consideration, it is a
""service"" as defined by Section 2 (o) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The
inordinate delay in handing over possession of the flat clearly amounts to deficiency of
service.
I n Fortune Infrastructure and Anr. v. Trevor D'Lima and Ors., MANU/SC/0253/2018 :
(2018) 5 SCC 442 this Court held that a person cannot be made to wait indefinitely for
possession of the flat allotted to him, and is entitled to seek refund of the amount paid
by him, along with compensation.
6.2. The Respondent-Flat Purchaser has made out a clear case of deficiency of service
on the part of the Appellant-Builder. The Respondent-Flat Purchaser was justified in
terminating the Apartment Buyer's Agreement by filing the Consumer Complaint, and
cannot be compelled to accept the possession whenever it is offered by the Builder. The
Respondent-Purchaser was legally entitled to seek refund of the money deposited by
him along with appropriate compensation.
6.3. The National Commission in the Impugned Order dated 23.10.2018 held that the
Clauses relied upon by the Builder were wholly one-sided, unfair and unreasonable, and
could not be relied upon.
The Law Commission of India in its 199th Report, addressed the issue of 'Unfair
(Procedural & Substantive) Terms in Contract'. The Law Commission inter-alia
recommended that a legislation be enacted to counter such unfair terms in contracts. In
the draft legislation provided in the Report, it was stated that:
A contract or a term thereof is substantively unfair if such contract or the term
thereof is in itself harsh, oppressive or unconscionable to one of the parties.
6.4. A perusal of the Apartment Buyer's Agreement dated 08.05.2012 reveals stark
incongruities between the remedies available to both the parties.
For instance, Clause 6.4 (ii) of the Agreement entitles the Appellant-Builder to charge
Interest @18% p.a. on account of any delay in payment of installments from the
Respondent-Flat Purchaser.
Clause 6.4 (iii) of the Agreement entitles the Appellant-Builder to cancel the allotment
and terminate the Agreement, if any installment remains in arrears for more than 30
days.
On the other hand, as per Clause 11.5 of the Agreement, if the Appellant-Builder fails to
deliver possession of the apartment within the stipulated period, the Respondent-Flat
Purchaser has to wait for a period of 12 months after the end of the grace period,
before serving a Termination Notice of 90 days on the Appellant-Builder, and even
thereafter, the Appellant-Builder gets 90 days to refund only the actual installment paid
by the Respondent-Flat Purchaser, after adjusting the taxes paid, interest and penalty on
delayed payments. In case of any delay thereafter, the Appellant-Builder is liable to pay
Interest @9% p.a. only.
6.5. Another instance is Clause 23.4 of the Agreement which entitles the Appellant-
Builder to serve a Termination Notice upon the Respondent-Flat Purchaser for breach of
any contractual obligation. If the Respondent-Flat Purchaser fails to rectify the default
within 30 days of the Termination Notice, then the Agreement automatically stands
cancelled, and the Appellant-Builder has the right to forfeit the entire amount of Earnest
Money towards liquidated damages.
On the other hand, as Clause 11.5 (v) of the Agreement, if the Respondent-Flat
Purchaser fails to exercise his right of termination within the time limit provided in
Clause 11.5, then he shall not be entitled to terminate the Agreement thereafter, and
shall be bound by the provisions of the Agreement.
6.6. Section 2 (r) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 defines 'unfair trade practices'
in the following words:
""'unfair trade practice' means a trade practice which, for the purpose of
promoting the sale, use or supply of any goods or for the provision of any
service, adopts any unfair method or unfair or deceptive practice ..."", and
includes any of the practices enumerated therein. The provision is illustrative,
and not exhaustive.
I n Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited and Ors. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly
and Ors., MANU/SC/0439/1986 : (1986) 3 SCC 156 this Court held that:
89. ... Our judges are bound by their oath to 'uphold the Constitution and the
laws'. The Constitution was enacted to secure to all the citizens of this country
social and economic justice. Article 14 of the Constitution guarantees to all
persons equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. This principle
is that the courts will not enforce and will, when called upon to do so, strike
down an unfair and unreasonable contract, or an unfair and unreasonable Clause
in a contract, entered into between parties who are not equal in bargaining
power. It is difficult to give an exhaustive list of all bargains of this type. No
court can visualize the different situations which can arise in the affairs of men.
One can only attempt to give some illustrations. For instance, the above
principle will apply where the inequality of bargaining power is the result of the
great disparity in the economic strength of the contracting parties. It will apply
where the inequality is the result of circumstances, whether of the creation of
the parties or not. It will apply to situations in which the weaker party is in a
position in which he can obtain goods or services or means of livelihood only
upon the terms imposed by the stronger party or go without them. It will also
apply where a man has no choice, or rather no meaningful choice, but to give
his assent to a contract or to sign on the dotted line in a prescribed or standard
form or to accept a set of Rules as part of the contract, however unfair,
unreasonable and unconscionable a Clause in that contract or form or Rules may
be. This principle, however, will not apply where the bargaining power of the
contracting parties is equal or almost equal. This principle may not apply where
both parties are businessmen and the contract is a commercial transaction. ...
... These cases can neither be enumerated nor fully illustrated. The court must judge
each case on its own facts and circumstances.
6.7. A term of a contract will not be final and binding if it is shown that the flat
purchasers had no option but to sign on the dotted line, on a contract framed by the
builder.
The contractual terms of the Agreement dated 08.05.2012 are ex-facie one-sided,
unfair, and unreasonable. The incorporation of such one-sided clauses in an agreement
constitutes an unfair trade practice as per Section 2 (r) of the Consumer Protection Act,
1986 since it adopts unfair methods or practices for the purpose of selling the flats by
the Builder.
7. In view of the above discussion, we have no hesitation in holding that the terms of
the Apartment Buyer's Agreement dated 08.05.2012 were wholly one-sided and unfair
to the Respondent-Flat Purchaser. The Appellant-Builder could not seek to bind the
Respondent with such one-sided contractual terms.
8 . We also reject the submission made by the Appellant-Builder that the National
Commission was not justified in awarding Interest @10.7% S.I. p.a. for the period
commencing from the date of payment of each installment, till the date on which the
amount was paid, excluding only the period during which the stay of cancellation of the
allotment was in operation.
In Bangalore Development Authority v. Syndicate Bank, MANU/SC/2718/2007 : (2007) 6
SCC 711 a Coordinate Bench of this Court held that when possession of the allotted
plot/flat/house is not delivered within the specified time, the allottee is entitled to a
refund of the amount paid, with reasonable Interest thereon from the date of payment
till the date of refund.
8.1. In the present case, the National Commission has passed an equitable Order. The
Commission has not awarded any Interest for the period during which the Order of stay
of cancellation of the allotment was in operation on the request of the Respondent-Flat
Purchaser.
The National Commission has rightly awarded Interest @10.7% S.I. p.a. by applying
Rule 15 of the Haryana Real Estate (Regulation And Development) Rules, 2017 from the
date of each installment till 05.02.2017 i.e. till the date after which the Order of stay of
cancellation of the allotment was passed; and thereafter, from the date of the
Commission's final Order till the date on which the amount is refunded with Interest.
9. We see no illegality in the Impugned Order dated 23.10.2018 passed by the National
Commission. The Appellant-Builder failed to fulfill his contractual obligation of
obtaining the Occupancy Certificate and offering possession of the flat to the
Respondent-Purchaser within the time stipulated in the Agreement, or within a
reasonable time thereafter. The Respondent-Flat Purchaser could not be compelled to
take possession of the flat, even though it was offered almost 2 years after the grace
period under the Agreement expired. During this period, the Respondent-Flat Purchaser
had to service a loan that he had obtained for purchasing the flat, by paying Interest
@10% to the Bank. In the meanwhile, the Respondent-Flat Purchaser also located an
alternate property in Gurugram. In these circumstances, the Respondent-Flat Purchaser
was entitled to be granted the relief prayed for i.e. refund of the entire amount
deposited by him with Interest.
1 0 . The Civil Appeals are accordingly dismissed, and the Final judgment and Order
dated 23.10.2018 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission is
affirmed. The Appellant is granted a period of three months from today to refund the
amount to the Respondent. All pending Applications, if any, are accordingly disposed of.","Appellants: Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd.

MATTERS RELATING TO CONSUMER PROTECTION - APPEALS UNDER SECTION 23 OF
THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 1986
Facts:
Appellant-Builder launched a residential project by name ""Araya Complex"" in
Golf Course Extension Road, Gurugram. Respondent-Flat Purchaser entered
into an Apartment Buyer's Agreement dated 8th May, 2012 with Appellant-
Builder to purchase an apartment in said project. As per Clause 11.2 of
Agreement, Appellant-Builder was to make all efforts to apply for Occupancy
Certificate within 39 months from the date of excavation, with a grace period
of 180 days. Appellant-Builder however failed to apply for Occupancy
Certificate as per stipulations in Agreement. Respondent-Flat Purchaser filed
a Consumer Complaint before National Commission alleging deficiency of
service on part of Appellant-Builder for failure to obtain Occupancy Certificate,
and hand over possession of flat. National Commission passed an ex-parte
Interim Order restraining Appellant-Builder from cancelling allotment made in
favour of Respondent-Flat Purchaser during pendency of Consumer Case.
During pendency of proceedings before National Commission, Appellant-
Builder obtained Occupancy Certificate, and issued a Possession Letter to
Respondent-Flat Purchaser. Respondent-Flat Purchaser however submitted
that, he was not interested in taking possession of apartment on account of
inordinate delay of almost 3 years. Respondent-Flat Purchaser stated that he
had, in meanwhile, taken an alternate property in Gurugram, and sought
refund of entire amount deposited by him along with Interest @18% p.a.
National Commission vide Final judgment allowed Consumer Complaint filed
by Respondent-Flat Purchaser, and held that since last date stipulated for
construction had expired about 3 years before Occupancy Certificate was
obtained, Respondent-Flat Purchaser could not be compelled to take
possession at such a belated stage. Appellant-Builder was directed to refund
amount deposited by Respondent-Flat Purchaser, along with Interest @10.7%
S.I. p.a. towards compensation. Aggrieved by Order passed by National
Commission, Appellant-Builder preferred present statutory Appeal.
Held, while dismissing the appeal
1. In present case, admittedly Appellant-Builder obtained Occupancy
Certificate almost 2 years after date stipulated in Apartment Buyer's
Agreement. As a consequence, there was a failure to hand over possession of
flat to Respondent-Flat Purchaser within a reasonable period. Occupancy
Certificate was obtained after a delay of more than 2 years on 28th August,
2018 during pendency of proceedings before National Commission. In
Lucknow Development Authority v. M.K. Gupta, present Court held that, when
a person hired services of a builder, or a contractor, for construction of a
house or a flat, and same was for a consideration, it was a ""service"" as
defined by Section 2 (o) of Act, 1986. Inordinate delay in handing over
possession of flat clearly amounted to deficiency of service. [6.1]
2. Respondent-Flat Purchaser had made out a clear case of deficiency of
service on part of Appellant-Builder. Respondent-Flat Purchaser was justified
in terminating Apartment Buyer's Agreement by filing Consumer Complaint,
and could not be compelled to accept possession whenever it was offered by
Builder. Respondent-Purchaser was legally entitled to seek refund of money
deposited by him along with appropriate compensation. [6.2]
3. National Commission in Impugned Order held that, Clauses relied upon by
Builder were wholly one-sided, unfair and unreasonable, and could not be
relied upon. [6.3]
4. A perusal of Apartment Buyer's Agreement dated 8th May, 2012 revealed
stark incongruities between remedies available to both parties. [6.3]
5. Section 2 (r) of Act, 1986 defined 'unfair trade practices' which meant a
trade practice which, for purpose of promoting sale, use or supply of any
goods or for provision of any service, adopts any unfair method or unfair or
deceptive practice ..."", and included any of the practices enumerated therein.
Provision was illustrative, and not exhaustive. [6.6]
6. A term of a contract would not be final and binding if it was shown that,
flat purchasers had no option but to sign on dotted line, on a contract framed
by builder. Contractual terms of Agreement dated 8th May, 2012 were exfacie
one-sided, unfair, and unreasonable. Incorporation of such one-sided
clauses in an agreement constituted an unfair trade practice as per Section 2
(r) of Act, 1986 since it adopted unfair methods or practices for purpose of
selling flats by Builder. [6.7]
7. Terms of Apartment Buyer's Agreement dated 8th May, 2012 were wholly
one-sided and unfair to Respondent-Flat Purchaser. Appellant-Builder could
not seek to bind Respondent with such one-sided contractual terms. [7]
8. Submission made by Appellant-Builder that, National Commission was not
justified in awarding Interest @10.7% S.I. p.a. for period commencing from
date of payment of each installment, till date on which amount was paid,
excluding only period during which stay of cancellation of allotment was in
operation was also rejected. In Bangalore Development Authority v. Syndicate
Bank, a Coordinate Bench of this Court held that when possession of allotted
plot/flat/house was not delivered within specified time, allottee was entitled
to a refund of amount paid, with reasonable Interest thereon from date of
payment till date of refund. [8]
9. In present case, National Commission had passed an equitable Order.
Commission had not awarded any Interest for period during which Order of
stay of cancellation of allotment was in operation on request of Respondent-
Flat Purchaser. National Commission had rightly awarded Interest @10.7%
S.I. p.a. by applying Rule 15 of Rules, 2017 from date of each installment till
date after which Order of stay of cancellation of allotment was passed; and
thereafter, from date of Commission's final Order till date on which amount
was refunded with Interest. [8.1]
10. Appellant-Builder failed to fulfill his contractual obligation of obtaining
Occupancy Certificate and offering possession of flat to the Respondent-
Purchaser within time stipulated in Agreement, or within a reasonable time
thereafter. Respondent-Flat Purchaser could not be compelled to take
possession of flat, even though it was offered almost 2 years after grace
period under Agreement expired. During this period, Respondent-Flat
Purchaser had to service a loan that he had obtained for purchasing flat, by
paying Interest @10% to Bank. In meanwhile, the Respondent-Flat Purchaser
also located an alternate property in Gurugram. In these circumstances,
Respondent-Flat Purchaser was entitled to be granted relief prayed for i.e.
refund of entire amount deposited by him with Interest. [9]

3. The original complainants had booked apartments in a project titled ""DLF Valley, Panchkula"" situated in
Panchkula, Haryana, which was to be developed by the Developer. The Developer had promised to
handover possession within 24 months from the date of signing of the agreement. Various complaints
came to be filed by the Complainants submitting that despite period of two years being over there was no
substantial progress and as such, the Developer was deficient in rendering service. Some of the
Complainants prayed for refund of all the moneys they had deposited from time to time along with interest
and compensation while others sought relief in the nature of compensation for delayed delivery of
possession but insisted that the possession of the apartments be handed over to them.
4 . The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, UT, Chandigarh (hereinafter referred to as 'the
State Commission') by its various orders allowed the complaints and directed refund of the amounts
deposited by the concerned Complainants with interest @ 15% per annum in some cases and with lesser
rate in others and compensation. Similar directions were passed in cases of delayed delivery of
possession. These orders passed by the State Commission were challenged by the Developer by filing
aforementioned First Appeals in the National Commission which were disposed of by the National
Commission vide its common order dated 07.09.2018. The National Commission affirmed the view taken
by the State Commission and dismissed all the appeals. Aggrieved thereby the present appeals by special
leave were filed by the Developer.
Re: Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 26519 of 2018 (Ravi Datt Aggarwal and Ors. v.
DLF Homes Panchkula Pvt. Ltd. and Ors.2
5. While the appeals as aforesaid were pending before the National Commission, it was submitted by the
Developer that there had to be at least one Judicial Member on the Bench and in cases where there was
not even one Judicial Member on the Bench, the appeals could not and ought not to be proceeded with.
After hearing all submissions, the National Commission by its order dated 01.08.2018 reserved the matters
for orders. Thereafter, Review Petitions were filed by the Developer which were rejected on 08.08.2018.
The Developer then filed a petition Under Article 227 of the Constitution being CM(M) No. 951 of 2018 in
the High Court of Delhi questioning said orders dated 01.08.2018 and 08.08.2018. While issuing notice,
the High Court by its order dated 20.08.2018 stayed the operation of the order dated 08.08.2018 passed
by the National Commission. The National Commission, thereafter, passed a reasoned judgment on
07.09.2018 rejecting all the submissions. However, in view of the fact that the order dated 08.08.2018
was stayed by the High Court, it observed that the operation of the judgment dated 07.09.2018 would
remain stayed till further orders by the High Court.
6. Some of the Complainants, being aggrieved, approached this Court by filing Special Leave Petition (c)
No. 26519 of 2018 in which, while issuing notice on 22.10.2018, this Court stayed the operation of the
order dated 20.08.2018 passed by the High Court.
7. Thereafter, the appeals filed by the Developer and the Complainants were taken-up together.
8. It may be mentioned that matters where the Developer had challenged similar directions issued in other
cases namely Civil Appeal Nos. 11097-11138 of 2018, were disposed of by this Court on 19.11.2018. In
those cases, (Himanshu Arora case, for short) the State Commission had awarded interest @ 12% which
was reduced by the National Commission to 9%. After hearing learned Counsel for both sides, this Court
had passed following directions: -
8 . Having regard to the above submission, we indicated to the learned Counsel appearing on
behalf of the flat purchasers that it would be appropriate if the interest as ordered by NCDRC at
9% per annum is made payable over the period which was determined by the Order of the SCDRC.
There is no objection by the flat purchasers to the aforesaid modification being made. Even
otherwise, we are of the view that such a modification would be required in the interests of justice
since it was the Appellants who had questioned the Order of the SCDRC before the NCDRC.
9 . In the above facts and circumstances, we confirm the direction of the NCDRC that the
Appellants shall pay interest @ 9 per cent per annum. However, the period over which interest
shall be payable will be in conformity with the order passed by the SCDRC.
10. We also direct that in computing the interest payable in terms of the Order of the NCDRC to
the extent modified above, the Appellants would be entitled to credit for the compensation, if any,
which has been paid to any flat buyer in terms of Clause 15 of the flat purchase agreements. In
other words, the amount of interest payable shall be computed after deducting any amount that
has been paid to the concerned flat buyer under Clause 15 of the agreement.
1 1 . The amount which has been deposited in this Court in pursuance of the order dated
18.5.2018, shall be transferred by the Registry to the Registrar of the SCDRC, Chandigarh. The
Appellants shall, within a period of two weeks from today, file a detailed computation with
reference to each of the flat buyers and the amount which is due and payable in pursuance of the
above directions. The amount shall be duly verified before disbursal, on proper identification, to
each of the flat buyers. After completing the above exercise, in the event, that any amount
(inclusive of the accrued interest) remains surplus, it shall be refunded to the Appellants.
12. Upon the transfer of the amount, the SCDRC shall keep the amount in a short term fixed
deposit until the stage of disbursement is reached.
The civil appeals are disposed of.
9 . When the present appeals were taken up, all the parties agreed that these appeals be disposed of in
terms with the directions issued by this Court in Himanshu Arora's case. We, therefore, directed the
Developer to file a Chart in consultation with all the complainants and indicate what modalities be
adopted. After such Chart was filed, it was agreed that wherever compensation was to be awarded, it
should be in the form of interest @ 9% and the governing principles be as under:
(a) In all Refund cases, the award of interest @ 9% would be payable in respect of deposits from
the day they were made till the date of refund.
(b) In cases where, upon transfer, a subsequent purchaser had stepped into the shoes of the
original allottee and had prayed for Refund, the reckoning date for computing the interest be from
the date of his transfer in respect of all the amounts that were deposited by the original allottee
and if any subsequent deposits were made by the transferee, from the dates of such deposits;
(c) In cases where Possession was sought, the period available to the Developer under the
agreement being three years (that is to say original period of two years which was extendable, at
the option of the Developer, by further period of one year) ought not to be computed while
calculating compensation in the form of interest. Therefore, the period to be reckoned shall be
after expiry of three years from the date of agreement and in respect of such period the
compensation shall be at the same rate of 9%.
(d) In Possession cases, if there was any transfer and the transferee had stepped into the shoes of
the original allottee, the compensation shall be paid from the date of expiry of three years from
the agreement as aforesaid or from the date of transfer, whichever is later.
10. The matter was, thereafter, adjourned so that the parties could check and reconcile all the concerned
amounts and present a mutually acceptable statement of figures. Accordingly, the Chart has been
presented which is appended to this judgment as Annexure-A.
11. Column No. 13 of the tabulated chart denotes element of interest @ 9% while Column No. 16 denotes
the amount that had been received by the Developer. Column No. 14 shows the amounts of FDRs
deposited by the Developer in respect of every Complainant, while Column No. 17 shows amount payable
to every Complainant or recoverable from such Complainant wherever excess amount was deposited.
According to the Chart, Serial Nos. 1 to 17 are Refund cases where Possession was not prayed for. Out of
these 17 cases, those at serial Nos. 9 and 16 were already settled and as such their cases3 shall not form
part of this group of appeals. Case at serial No. 17 was a transfer case in the category of Refund cases and
as such would be governed by principle (b) as stated hereabove. Rest of the cases in the Refund category
will be governed by principle (a) stated hereinabove except the case of Colonel Naresh Kumar Kohli,
whose name is at Serial No. 14 which will be subject to modification as stated hereafter.
12. According to Colonel Kohli, the fact that he had deposited Rs. 62,04,014/- was not disputed at any
juncture either before the State Commission or the National Commission and in fact FDR in that sum
already stood deposited by the Developer. However, in his case Column No. 16 wrongly mentioned figure
of Rs. 60,54,812/- and consequently the amount payable in Column No. 17 was wrongly shown as Rs.
24,60,356/-. We heard learned Counsel for the Developer and Colonel Kohli on this issue and find that the
submission made by Colonel Kohli deserves acceptance. We, therefore, correct the figures in Column Nos.
16 and 17 to be Rs. 62,04,014/- and Rs. 26,09,558/- respectively. He shall be entitled, over and above the
amount deposited in FD namely Rs. 62,04,014/-, an amount of Rs. 26,09,558/- as well.
13. We now turn to Possession cases which are tabulated from serial Nos. 18 to 48 (except case at serial
No. 32). Let the case of Mr. Gautam Kashyup at Serial No. 32, namely Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.
968 of 2019 be listed before a regular Court. All other matters in Possession category stand disposed of in
terms of the directions (c) and (d) as issued above.
14. Except to the extent any exception or modification stated in this judgment every person in Refund and
Possession categories is aggregable to the disposal of their matters in terms of the understanding as above
and the governing principles set out earlier.
15. It is directed that, on the strength of this order and upon proper identification to the satisfaction of
the State Commission, the amounts standing in Fixed Deposit Receipts against each of the Complainant
along with interest, if any, accrued thereon be made over to said complainant within six weeks from today.
We also direct the Developer to make over to each complainant the amount in Column No. 17 marked as
""Amount Recoverable/Payable"" within six weeks. In two cases i.e. in appeals arising out of Special Leave
Petition (Civil) Nos. 928 of 2019 and 936 of 2019 where the excess amount has been deposited, the
Developer will be entitled to have such excess amount recovered from the amounts presently lying in
deposit.
1 6 . In respect of the matter at serial No. 8 relating to original allottee named Arun Yadav, certain
additional directions are called for. Said original allottee is no more. While making the booking he had
mentioned the name of his wife as a nominee. He has left behind his widow, two children and mother. The
widow and the mother are individually claiming refund of the amount deposited by him. At this stage, the
entitlement of either side cannot be gone into and the parties must be left to agitate this issue in a
properly instituted matter before a competent court. However, considering the fact that the mother, the
widow and two children, going by normal law relating to intestate succession for Hindus, would share the
property of the deceased person equally, we direct 3/4 of the sum to be made over to the widow who shall
take said sum for herself and on behalf of two children while the remaining 1/4 of the sum shall be made
over to the mother. They must however execute indemnity bonds agreeing to return the sum that they had
received in whole or in part, in case a declaration as to their entitlement by a competent court were to go
against them.
1 7 . Since, the matters are being disposed of on an agreed understanding and since no order of
compensation was passed in Himanshu Arora, no compensation other than what has been dealt with
earlier, need be paid to the Complainants.
18. Finally, we direct:
(a) SLP(C) Nos. 931 and 939 of 2019 stand disposed of as having been settled by the parties.
(b) SLP(C) No. 968 of 2019 be listed for consideration before appropriate Bench in due course.
(c) All the appeals stand disposed of in terms indicated above.
(d) No costs.","Appellants: DLF Homes Panchkula (P.) Ltd.

promised to handover possession within 24 months from date of signing of agreement. Various
complaints came to be filed by Complainants submitting that, despite period of two years
being over there was no substantial progress and as such, Developer was deficient in
rendering service. Some of Complainants prayed for refund of all moneys they had deposited
from time to time along with interest and compensation while others sought relief in the
nature of compensation for delayed delivery of possession but insisted that possession of
apartments be handed over to them. State Commission by its various orders allowed
complaints and directed refund of amounts deposited by concerned Complainants with interest
@ 15% per annum in some cases and with lesser rate in others and compensation. Similar
directions were passed in cases of delayed delivery of possession. These orders passed by
State Commission were challenged by Developer by filing First Appeals in National Commission
which were disposed of by National Commission vide its common order. National Commission
affirmed view taken by State Commission and dismissed all appeals. Aggrieved thereby
present appeals by special leave were filed by Developer.
Held, while disposing of the appeals
1. When present appeals were taken up, all parties agreed that, these appeals be disposed of
in terms with directions issued by this Court in Himanshu Arora's case. Developer was directed
to file a Chart in consultation with all complainants and indicate what modalities be adopted.
After such Chart was filed, it was agreed that wherever compensation was to be awarded, it
should be in form of interest @ 9%. In all Refund cases, award of interest @ 9% would be
payable in respect of deposits from day, they were made till date of refund. In cases where,
upon transfer, a subsequent purchaser had stepped into shoes of original allottee and had
prayed for Refund, reckoning date for computing interest be from date of his transfer in
respect of all amounts that were deposited by original allottee and if any subsequent deposits
were made by transferee, from dates of such deposits; In cases where Possession was sought,
period available to Developer under agreement being three years (that is to say original period
of two years which was extendable, at option of Developer, by further period of one year)
ought not to be computed while calculating compensation in form of interest. Therefore,
period to be reckoned shall be after expiry of three years from date of agreement and in
respect of such period the compensation shall be at same rate of 9%. In Possession cases, if
there was any transfer and transferee had stepped into shoes of original allottee,
compensation shall be paid from date of expiry of three years from agreement as aforesaid or
from date of transfer, whichever was later. [9]
2. Matter was, thereafter, adjourned so that parties could check and reconcile all concerned
amounts and present a mutually acceptable statement of figures. Accordingly, Chart had been
presented. [10]
3. Column No. 13 of tabulated chart denoted element of interest @ 9% while Column No. 16
denoted amount that had been received by the Developer. Column No. 14 showed amounts of
FDRs deposited by Developer in respect of every Complainant, while Column No. 17 showed
amount payable to every Complainant or recoverable from such Complainant wherever excess
amount was deposited. According to Chart, Serial Nos. 1 to 17 were Refund cases where
Possession was not prayed for. Out of these 17 cases, those at serial Nos. 9 and 16 were
already settled and as such their cases shall not form part of this group of appeals. [11]
4. Except to extent any exception or modification stated in this judgment, every person in
Refund and Possession categories was aggregable to disposal of their matters in terms of
understanding and governing principles set out earlier. [14]
5. It is directed that, on the strength of this order and upon proper identification to the
satisfaction of the State Commission, the amounts standing in Fixed Deposit Receipts against
each of the Complainant along with interest, if any, accrued thereon be made over to said
complainant within six weeks. Developer was directed to make over to each complainant
amount in Column No. 17 marked as ""Amount Recoverable/Payable"" within six weeks. In two
cases i.e. in appeals arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) Nos. 928 of 2019 and 936 of
2019 where excess amount had been deposited, Developer would be entitled to have such
excess amount recovered from amounts presently lying in deposit. [15]
6. Since, matters were being disposed of on an agreed understanding and since no order of
compensation was passed in Himanshu Arora, no compensation other than what had been
dealt with earlier, need be paid to Complainants. [17]",,,,
"Navin Sinha, J.
1. The acquittal of the Appellant by the Special Judge, Shimla in Sessions Trial No. 7-
S/7/2012, from the charge Under Sections 20 and 61 of the Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (hereinafter referred as 'the Act') has been reversed
by the High Court. The Appellant has been sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment and
fine of Rs. 2,00,000/-. Thus the present appeal.
2. The Appellant is stated to have been apprehended at Majhotli, by the police party, on
suspicion, at about 6.15 A.M. after he disembarked from the State public transport bus
going from Nerwa to Chamunda. Two kilograms of Charas is stated to have been
recovered from a bag in his possession in presence of PW-2, Sita Ram an independent
witness. DW-1 Shayam Singh, the depot in-charge at Nerwa, and DW-2 Khem Raj, the
conductor of the bus in question were examined as defence witnesses.
3. After consideration of the entirety of the evidence, particularly that of PW-2 and DW-
2, and also noticing that PW-1, Constable Rakesh Kumar, an eye-witness to the
incident, had not been mentioned as a witness in the seizure memo Exhibit PW-1/B, the
Special Judge opined that two theories had emerged with regard to the accusations
against the Appellant. The Appellant was acquitted, giving him the benefit of doubt.
4. The High Court reversed the acquittal, holding that PW-2 had admitted his signatures
on Exhibit PW-1/B, the bag along with the narcotic, Ex. PW-2/A seal impression, Ex.
PW-2/D the arrest memo and the Ex. PW-2/E personal search memo. No complaint had
been lodged by the witness that he had been compelled by the police to sign the
documents under pressure. The statements of the official witnesses, PW-1 Rakesh
Kumar and PW-6 Head Constable Parmanand, were trustworthy, inspiring confidence,
and could not be rejected only on the ground that they were police personnel. Any
discrepancy with regard to distance and travelling time between Nerwa and Majhotli
could be attributed to memory loss with passage of time, and was not required to be
with mathematical precision. The time with regard to purchase of bus ticket had not
been established.
5 . Learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that he has been falsely implicated. He
was deboarded from the bus at Chopal after it arrived from Majhotli and the narcotics
planted on him. There had been no recovery from him. The bus ticket evidently reveals
that he boarded the bus at 6:51 A.M. The question of his being apprehended at 6:15
A.M. simply does not arise. The road distance from Nerwa to Majhotli was 26 kms. as
deposed by DW-1. In the hills, it would have taken the bus at least one hour or more,
to cover this distance. The bus could not have reached Majhotli till 8:00 A.M. or
thereafter. PW-2, the independent witness, deposed that he was stopped by the police
at about 10.30 A.M. at Majhotli and after checking his motor cycle papers was allowed
to leave. He was called to the Police Station at 1.00 P.M. and asked to put his signatures
on certain documents. The witness denied any search, seizure and recovery from the
Appellant in his presence. If an independent witness was available, and relied upon by
the prosecution, his evidence could not be discarded without reason, to hold that the
police version was the truth. Additional submissions were made with regard to noncompliance
with Section 50 of the Act, as there was personal search also, and that the
complainant himself could not be the investigating officer. Reliance was placed on
Basappa v. State of Karnataka MANU/SC/0174/2014 : 2014 (5) SCC 154 that if two
views were possible, the acquittal ought not to have been interfered with in appeal.
6. We have considered the submissions on behalf of the parties, and also examined the
evidence and other materials on record.
7 . The public bus, on which the Appellant was traveling, was going from Nerwa to
Chamunda. The ticket issued to the Appellant Exhibit DX, proved by the bus Conductor
DW-2, bears the time of issuance 6.51 A.M., visible to the naked eye. The distance from
Nerwa to Majhotli, is 26 kms. as deposed by DW-1. We find substance in the
submission on behalf of the Appellant, that the travelling time for the bus, in the hills,
for this distance would be one hour or more. Prima facie, the prosecution story that the
Appellant was apprehended at Majhotli at 6.15 A.M. becomes seriously doubtful if not
impossible. The bus would have reached Majhotli at about 8.00 A.M. or thereafter only.
The conclusion of the High Court that passage of time, and memory loss, were sufficient
explanation for the time difference, is held to be perverse, and without proper
consideration of Exhibit DX. PW-2, the independent witness has stated that he was
stopped at Majhotli by the police at 10.30 A.M. and was allowed to leave after
verification of his motor cycle papers. The witness has specifically denied that the
Appellant was apprehended in his presence and that any search, seizure and recovery
was conducted in his presence. He had deposed that he was called to the police station
at 1:00 P.M. and asked to sign the papers. The witness was declared hostile. This
aspect has not been considered by the High Court, which proceeded on the only
assumption that the signatures were admitted.
8 . In a case of sudden recovery, independent witness may not be available. But if an
independent witness is available, and the prosecution initially seeks to rely upon him, it
cannot suddenly discard the witness because it finds him inconvenient, and place
reliance upon police witnesses only. In the stringent nature of the provisions of the Act,
the reverse burden of proof, the presumption of culpability Under Section 35, and the
presumption against the Accused Under Section 54, any reliance upon Section 114 of
the Evidence Act in the facts of the present case, can only be at the risk of a fair trial to
the accused. Karamjit Singh v. State (Delhi Administration) MANU/SC/0245/2003
: AIR 2003 SC 1311, is distinguishable on its facts as independent witness had refused
to sign because of the fear of terrorists. Likewise S. Jeevananthanan v. State
MANU/SC/0494/2004 : 2004 (5) SCC 230, also does not appear to be a case where
independent witnesses were available.
9 . The presumption against the Accused of culpability Under Section 35, and Under
Section 54 of the Act to explain possession satisfactorily, are rebuttable. It does not
dispense with the obligation of the prosecution to prove the charge beyond all
reasonable doubt. The presumptive provision with reverse burden of proof, does not
sanction conviction on basis of preponderance of probability. Section 35 (2) provides
that a fact can be said to have been proved if it is established beyond reasonable doubt
and not on preponderance of probability. That the right of the Accused to a fair trial
could not be whittled down under the Act was considered in Noor Aga v. State of
58 ...An initial burden exists upon the prosecution and only when it stands
satisfied, would the legal burden shift. Even then, the standard of proof
required for the Accused to prove his innocence is not as high as that of the
prosecution. Whereas the standard of proof required to prove the guilt of the
Accused on the prosecution is ""beyond all reasonable doubt"" but it is
""preponderance of probability"" on the accused. If the prosecution fails to prove
the foundational facts so as to attract the rigours of Section 35 of the Act, the
actus reus which is possession of contraband by the Accused cannot be said to
have been established.
59. With a view to bring within its purview the requirements of Section 54 of
the Act, element of possession of the contraband was essential so as to shift
the burden on the accused. The provisions being exceptions to the general rule,
the generality thereof would continue to be operative, namely, the element of
possession will have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.
1 0 . In the facts of the present case, and the nature of evidence as discussed, the
prosecution had failed to establish the foundational facts beyond all reasonable doubt.
The special judge committed no error in acquitting the Appellant. The High Court ought
not to have interfered with the same. The submissions regarding non-compliance with
Section 50 of the Act, or that the complainant could not be the investigating officer are
not considered necessary to deal with in the facts of the case.
11. I n Basappa (supra), it was observed that the High Court before setting aside an
order of acquittal was required to record a finding that the conclusions of the Trial Court
were so perverse and wholly unreasonable, so as not to be a plausible view by
misreading and incorrect appreciation of evidence. The conclusions of the High Court in
the facts of the present case are more speculative, based on conjectures and surmises,
contrary to the weight of the evidence on record.
12. The order of the High Court is set aside. The acquittal of the Appellant ordered by
the Special Judge is restored. The Appellant is set at liberty forthwith, unless wanted in
any other case. The appeal is allowed.","Appellants: Naresh Kumar

CRIMINAL MATTERS - APPEAL UNDER SECTION 2 OF THE SUPREME COURT
(ENLARGEMENT OF JURISDICTION) ACT
Facts:
Contraband substance was recovered from the Appellant. After consideration
of the entirety of the evidence Trial Court held that two theories had emerged
with regard to the accusations against the Appellant. The Appellant was
acquitted, giving him the benefit of doubt. The High Court reversed acquittal
order on ground that statement of witnesses were trustworthy, inspiring
confidence, and could not be rejected only on the ground that they were
police personnel. Hence, present appeal was filed by Appellant.
Held, while allowing the appeal:
(i) The prosecution story that the Appellant was apprehended became
seriously doubtful if not impossible. The conclusion of the High Court that
passage of time, and memory loss, were sufficient explanation for the time
difference, was held to be perverse, and without proper consideration. The
independent witness had stated that he was stopped and was allowed to
leave after verification of his motor cycle papers. The witness had denied that
the Appellant was apprehended in his presence and that any search, seizure
and recovery was conducted in his presence. The witness had deposed that he
was called to the police station and asked to sign the papers. The witness was
declared hostile. That aspect had not been considered by the High Court,
which proceeded on the only assumption that the signatures were admitted.
The prosecution had failed to establish the foundational facts beyond all
reasonable doubt. The conclusions of the High Court were more speculative,
based on conjectures and surmises, contrary to the weight of the evidence on
record. Acquittal order of Trial Court was restored. Impugned order was set
aside. [7] and[10]",,,,
"1. These appeals by special leave are directed against the judgment and order dated
12.1.2009 passed by the High Court of Judicature of Jharkhand at Ranchi in Criminal
Appeal No. 240 of 2002 with Criminal Appeal No. 302 of 2002.
2. These appeals have been filed by Accused No. 1 and Accused No. 4 questioning the
conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court on 17 and 18th May, 2002 wherein
the Accused were convicted for the offence Under Section 392 and were sentenced to
seven years' rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 1000/- each and in default of
payment, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year each and also convicted for
the offence Under Section 302 and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life
and a fine of Rs. 5000/- each and in default of payment to undergo rigorous
imprisonment for a term of 2 years each.
3. The judgment passed by the trial Court was subsequently challenged before the High
Court. The High Court also confirmed the sentence and conviction passed by the trial
Court.
4 . In the present case there were as many as five Accused. A-5 was acquitted by the
trial Court itself. The other two Accused A-2 and A-3 had filed Special leave Petition
(Criminal) No(s). 2572-2573 of 2009 against the judgment and order of the High Court,
which were dismissed by this Court at the time of admission itself. In criminal cases, it
is well settled that a dismissal of a SLP in limine, would neither mean that the lower
court judgment stands affirmed nor the principle res judicata would be applicable [refer
Kunhayammed and Anr. v. State of Kerala MANU/SC/0432/2000 : AIR 2000 SC 2587;
State of Punjab v. Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar MANU/SC/1476/2011 : AIR 2012 SC 364].
Therefore, the dismissal of the SLP of the co-accused will not have any effect
accordingly.
5 . In the instant special leave petitions filed by the Accused A-1 and A-4, leave was
granted by this Court on 30.8.2010.
6. We have heard learned Counsel for the parties.
7 . The prosecution story in brief is that on 3.12.1999, Truck No. BR-24-M-8171 had
gone to Balrampur having loaded the lac of one Adit Sah of Latehar. The truck was
returning from Balrampur after unloading the lac in question on 4.12.1999 and reached
Ranchi at 4 P.M. The aforesaid truck had picked up its owner Sita Devi from Seva
Sadan, Ranchi and proceeded for Latehar. When the truck did not reach Latehar till the
morning of 5/12/1999, PW-2, Binod Agrawal (the joint owner of the truck and brotherin-
law of Sita Devi, and the informant in this case) tried to search for the truck; in the
course of his search he went to the Line Hotel, owned by PW-1, Bindeshwar Sah,
situated at Ranchi Road, Kuru where the truck usually used to stop for refreshment for
its staff. The informant learnt from the aforesaid hotel owner that his truck had stopped
at the hotel on 4.12.1999 at about 6.45 p.m. The driver, Suresh Singh @ Bulet Singh,
and the Khalasi (i.e., cleaner of the truck), Jitendra Thakur, had taken four cups of
special tea, one for their employer Sita Devi, two for themselves and one for a third
person in the truck, but the third person did not take tea and the same was returned.
The driver was heard to say that A-2, Mahendra, the third person inside the truck,
would not take tea. Thereafter, the truck proceeded for its destination, having taken the
owner Sita Devi, the Khalasi Jitendra Thakur, and the third person, Mahendra (apart
from the driver himself). The informant also came to know from the hotel owner that an
unknown person aged about 25 years had also come to the hotel at 5.00 p.m. on
4.12.1999, who had enquired from the hotel owner whether Suresh Singh @ Bulet
Singh, the driver, had come to the hotel with the truck. The hotel owner had replied to
the unknown person that the truck had not reached yet. Subsequently, the informant
gathered information from others at Kuru that the truck had crossed Kuru Chowk for its
destination (i.e. Latehar), but it was hijacked by some criminals near Kuru P.S. and
taken away towards the forest. He further came to know that the truck was lying
abandoned in Aamjharia Valley with two dead bodies lying near the truck and one dead
body of a woman lying inside the cabin of the truck. On such information, he went to
Aamjharia Valley and found the truck, where he found the dead body of Sita Devi inside
the truck, with her hands tied and neck slit, and the bodies of the driver and Khalasi
thrown outside. The informant then went to Kuru P.S. to lodge an FIR, but the police of
Kuru P.S. did not entertain his information. He then went to Lohardaga to approach the
S.P., who was not available, but the reader of the S.P. told him that the FIR had to be
lodged in the Police Station in the jurisdiction of which the dead bodies had been
recovered. Therefore, the informant lodged the FIR at Chandwa Police Station on
7.12.1999 at 10 A.M., which is the basis of the case.
8 . Mr. Annam D.N. Rao, learned Amicus Curiae appearing on behalf of the Accused
mainly contended that the trial Court as well as the High Court had convicted the
Accused by relying upon the extra-judicial confessions made by Mahendra Prasad and
Chanchal Bhaskar (A-2 and A-3). Mr. Rao contended that the Accused could not be
convicted merely on the basis of extra-judicial confessions, relying upon the settled
proposition of law that an extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence, and an
Accused cannot be convicted on such basis in the absence of other reliable evidence
establishing guilt. He placed reliance on the decisions of this Court to this effect in
Gopal Sah v. State of Bihar MANU/SC/8348/2008 : (2008) 17 SCC 128 and Pancho v.
State of Haryana MANU/SC/1275/2011 : (2011) 10 SCC 165.
9 . Learned Counsel, while arguing, has taken us through the depositions of various
witnesses. PW-1 is Bindeshwar Sah, the hotel owner, who according to PW-2, Binod
Agrawal, first revealed the information to him that the truck party had come to his hotel
on the date of the incident, and left the place after taking some tea. Based on the said
information, PW-2 further inquired about the matter. PW-2 also deposed that PW-1 had
told him that A-2 Mahendra was inside the truck, and that A-2 had confessed to him
(i.e. PW-1) that the Accused had committed the murder of the three persons and further
committed theft of a gold bangle and chain belonging to Sita Devi, an amount of Rs. 2
Lac and a demand draft for Rs. 32,000/-. PW-2 admitted so in his cross-examination as
well as stated so before the police. At the time of trial, however, PW-1, the owner of the
Line Hotel, turned hostile. He denied saying anything to PW-2 as alleged.
1 0 . Thus, according to PW-2, A-2 made a confession to PW-1. In addition, the
confessions of A-2 and A-3 were also recorded by the police. As per the testimony of
PW-6, the investigating officer in the case, on the basis of the confession of A-3, a rope
was recovered from the place of occurrence.
11. Learned Counsel for the Appellants contended that rope is a common material or
thing which is available anywhere in the market and in every household.
12. Apart from this, learned Counsel for the State is unable to show any other material
indicating the guilt of the Appellants.
13. Learned Counsel for the State argued in support of the impugned judgment.
1 4 . The evidence relating to the extra-judicial confession made by the Accused
Mahendra is found in two places in the evidence of PW-2, i.e., in paragraphs 8 and 27.
If we read both the paragraphs, it is clear that PW-2 got the information from PW-1 (the
owner of the Line Hotel, Bindeshwar Sah) about the factum of confession made by the
Accused Mahendra before PW-1. In other words, PW-2 has not deposed in so many
words and clearly that the Accused Mahendra made a confession before him. On the
other hand, it is the specific deposition of PW-2 that the Accused Mahendra confessed
before PW-1, and in turn PW-1 told about the same fact to PW-2. This means that the
information received by PW-2 from PW-1 about the extra-judicial confession is hearsay,
inasmuch as there is no confession made by the Accused Mahendra before PW-2
directly. Hence, such hearsay evidence of PW-2 relating to the so-called confession
cannot be relied upon. Even otherwise, PW-1, who had allegedly informed PW-2 about
the confession allegedly made before him by the Accused Mahendra, has turned hostile.
Thus, there is no supporting material to corroborate the evidence of PW-2 regarding the
extra-judicial confession.
15. However, the First Appellate Court as well as the High Court, probably relying upon
the version of PW-2 in paragraphs 29 to 30 of his deposition, concluded that the
Accused Mahendra did confess before PW-2 directly. Even if we take it that the Accused
Mahendra did confess before PW-2 directly, the same may not further or better the case
of the prosecution, inasmuch as this is the solitary piece of material against the Accused
Mahendra, and that too in the form of an extra-judicial confession.
16. As argued by the learned amicus curiae appearing for the Accused, an extra-judicial
confession is a weak piece of evidence, and an Accused cannot be convicted on its basis
in the absence of other reliable evidence establishing the guilt of the Accused. It will be
pertinent to advert to the decisions relied upon by the learned amicus curiae at this
juncture, i.e., Gopal Sah (supra) and Pancho (supra).
17. In Gopal Sah (supra), the Court held that an extra-judicial confession is, on the
face of it, a weak piece of evidence and should not be relied upon to record a
conviction, in the absence of a chain of cogent circumstances. In Pancho (supra) as
well, the Court refused to convict the Accused on the basis of an extra-judicial
confession, in the absence of other evidence of sterling quality on record, establishing
his involvement. In the Pancho (supra), the Court discussed the evidentiary value of an
extra-judicial confession, as laid down by a Constitutional Bench of this Court in
Haricharan Kurmi v. State of Bihar MANU/SC/0059/1964 : AIR 1964 SC 1184. In this
case, referring to Section 3 and Section 30 of the Evidence Act, 1872, the Court came to
the conclusion that an extra-judicial confession cannot be treated as a substantive piece
of evidence against the co-accused, holding that the proper judicial approach is to use it
only to strengthen the opinion formed by the Court after perusing other evidence placed
on record. It is pertinent to refer to the observations of in Pancho (supra) in this
regard-
26. In Haricharan Kurmi v. State of Bihar [MANU/SC/0059/1964 : AIR 1964 SC
1184: (1964) 2 Cri. L J 344] the Constitution Bench of this Court was again
considering the same question. The Constitution Bench referred to Section 3 of
the Evidence Act, 1872 and observed that confession of a co-accused is not
evidence within the meaning of Section 3 of the Evidence Act. It is neither oral
statement which the court permits or requires to be made before it as per
Section 3(1) of the Evidence Act nor does it fall in the category of evidence
referred to in Section 3(2) of the Evidence Act which covers all documents
produced for the inspection of the court. This Court observed that even then
Section 30 provides that a confession may be taken into consideration not only
against its maker, but also against a co-accused. Thus, though such a
confession may not be evidence as strictly defined by Section 3 of the Evidence
Act, ""it is an element which may be taken into consideration by the criminal
court and in that sense, it may be described as evidence in a non-technical
way"". (Haricharan case [MANU/SC/0059/1964 : AIR 1964 SC 1184])
27. This Court in Haricharan case [MANU/SC/0059/1964 : AIR 1964 SC 1184:
(1964) 2 Cri. L J 344] further observed that Section 30 merely enables the court
to take the confession into account. It is not obligatory on the court to take the
confession into account. This Court reiterated that a confession cannot be
treated as substantive evidence against a co-accused. Where the prosecution
relies upon the confession of one Accused against another, the proper approach
is to consider the other evidence against such an Accused and if the said
evidence appears to be satisfactory and the court is inclined to hold that the
said evidence may sustain the charge framed against the said Accused, the
court turns to the confession with a view to assuring itself that the conclusion
which it is inclined to draw from the other evidence is right.
28. This Court in Haricharan case [MANU/SC/0059/1964 : AIR 1964 SC 1184:
(1964) 2 Cri. L J 344] clarified that though confession may be regarded as
evidence in generic sense because of the provisions of Section 30 of the
Evidence Act, the fact remains that it is not evidence as defined in Section 3 of
the Evidence Act. Therefore, in dealing with a case against an Accused, the
court cannot start with the confession of a co-accused; it must begin with other
evidence adduced by the prosecution and after it has formed its opinion with
regard to the quality and effect of the said evidence, then it is permissible to
turn to the confession in order to receive assurance to the conclusion of guilt
which the judicial mind is about to reach on the said other evidence.
18. Furthermore, in Sahadevan v. State of T.N., MANU/SC/0499/2012 : (2012) 6 SCC
403 this Court culled out certain principles regarding the reliability of an extra judicial
confession, which have also been relied upon in Jagroop Singh v. State of Punjab,
MANU/SC/0586/2012 : (2012) 11 SCC 768 Tejinder Singh v. State of Punjab,
MANU/SC/0355/2013 : (2013) 12 SCC 503 and Vijay Shankar v. State of Haryana
MANU/SC/0837/2015 : (2015) 12 SCC 644. The principles as stated in Sahadevan
(supra) are reproduced below:
16. Upon a proper analysis of the abovereferred judgments of this Court, it will
be appropriate to state the principles which would make an extra-judicial
confession an admissible piece of evidence capable of forming the basis of
conviction of an Accused. These precepts would guide the judicial mind while
dealing with the veracity of cases where the prosecution heavily relies upon an
extra-judicial confession alleged to have been made by the Accused:
(i) The extra-judicial confession is a weak evidence by itself. It has to
be examined by the court with greater care and caution.
(ii) It should be made voluntarily and should be truthful.
(iii) It should inspire confidence.
(iv) An extra-judicial confession attains greater credibility and
evidentiary value if it is supported by a chain of cogent circumstances
and is further corroborated by other prosecution evidence.
(v) For an extra-judicial confession to be the basis of conviction, it
should not suffer from any material discrepancies and inherent
improbabilities.
(vi) Such statement essentially has to be proved like any other fact and
in accordance with law.
The proposition that extra judicial confessions are a weak type of evidence and should
not be relied upon in the absence of corroborative evidence has also been affirmed by
this Court in several other decisions, such as Pakkiriswamy v. State of Tamil Nadu,
MANU/SC/1319/1997 : (1997) 8 SCC 158 Makhan Sigh v. State of Punjab,( 1988) Supp
SCC 526 Baldev Singh v. State of Punjab, MANU/SC/0903/2009 : (2009) 6 SCC 564 and
even recently in Satish v. State of Haryana MANU/SC/0672/2017 : (2018) 11 SCC 300.
19. Taking into consideration all the facts and position of law, discussed supra, we are
of the opinion that the Appellants herein cannot be convicted on the basis of only two
extra-judicial confessional statements of the co-accused which were not corroborated by
any cogent or reliable evidence. Needless to say, that the confessions of A-2 and A-3
made before the police are inadmissible. Now coming to the limited aspect concerning
appending weightage to their recovery of rope in furtherance of the statement of A-3,
before the Police Under Section 27 of Indian Evidence Act.
20. The law under, Section 27, Indian Evidence Act is well settled now, wherein this
Court in Geejaganda Somaiah v. State of Karnataka, MANU/SC/7211/2007 : (2007) 9
SCC 315, has observed as under:
As the Section is alleged to be frequently misused by the police, the courts are
required to be vigilant about its application. The court must ensure the
credibility of evidence by police because this provision is vulnerable to abuse.
It does not, however, mean that any statement made in terms of the aforesaid
Section should be seen with suspicion and it cannot be discarded only on the
ground that it was made to a police officer during investigation. The court has
to be cautious that no effort is made by the prosecution to make out a
statement of the Accused with a simple case of recovery as a case of discovery
of fact in order to attract the provisions of Section 27 of the Evidence Act.
21. The basic premise of Section 27 is to only partially lift the ban against admissibility
of inculpatory statements made before police, if a fact is actually discovered in
consequence of the information received from the Accused. Such condition would afford
some guarantee. We may additionally note that, the courts need to be vigilant while
considering such evidences. This Court in multiple cases has reiterated the aforesaid
principles Under Section 27 of Indian Evidence Act and only utilized Section 27 for
limited aspect concerning recovery [refer Pulukuri Kotayya v. King Emperor,
MANU/PR/0046/1947 : 76 I.A. 65; Jaffar Hussain Dastagir v. State of Maharashtra
MANU/SC/0106/1969 : AIR 1970 SC 1934]. As an additional safeguard we may note
that reliance on certain observations made in certain precedents of this Court without
understanding the background of the case may not be sustainable. There is no
gainsaying that it is only the ratio which has the precedential value and the same may
not be extended to an obiter. As this Court being the final forum for appeal, we need to
be cognizant of the fact that this Court generally considers only legal aspects relevant to
the facts and circumstances of that case, without elaborately discussing the minute
hyper-technicalities and factual intricacies involved in the trial.
22. Coming back to factual aspects of this case, on the basis of the above confession of
Chanchal Bhaskar [A-3], the only recovery which was made was one Rope, which was
used in committing the offence, which the counsel rightly pointed, is a common
material or thing which is available anywhere in the market or at every household.
Further, we may note that, there is no investigation to link the rope recovered with the
crime as no report concerning the forensic aspects of the fiber or any recovered strands
are part of the record. Therefore, the major condition for application of Section 27 of
the Evidence Act is not fulfilled. Accordingly, we cannot append any value to the
confession of Chanchal Bhaskar [A-3].
23. In light of the discussion above, we set aside the orders passed by the trial Court
as well as by the High Court and acquit the Accused from all charges and the appeals
are, accordingly, allowed.
24. We appreciate the assistance given by Mr. Annam D.N. Rao, learned Amicus Curiae
in disposing of these appeals.","Appellants: Kusal Toppo and Ors.

CRIMINAL MATTERS - CRIMINAL MATTERS IN WHICH SENTENCE AWARDED IS LIFE
IMPRISONMENT
Facts:
The Trial Court convicted Appellants for offence of murder and robbery under
Sections 302 and 392 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. The High Court, on appeal,
confirmed judgment of conviction passed by the Trial Court.
Held, while allowing the appeal:
(i) The evidence relating to the extra-judicial confession made by the Accused
was found in two places in the evidence of informant. Informant got the
information from the owner of the Hotel about the factum of confession made
by the Accused. The information received by informant from owner of hotel
about the extra-judicial confession was hearsay, inasmuch as there is no
confession made by the Accused directly. Hence, such hearsay evidence
relating to the so-called confession could not be relied upon. [14]
(ii) The Appellants could not be convicted on the basis of only two extrajudicial
confessional statements of the co-accused which were not
corroborated by any cogent or reliable evidence. [19]
(iii) The basic premise of Section 27 of Act is to only partially lift the ban
against admissibility of inculpatory statements made before police, if a fact is
actually discovered in consequence of the information received from the
Accused. Such condition would afford some guarantee. [21]
(iv) On the basis of the confession of Accused No. 3, the only recovery which
was made was one Rope, which was used in committing the offence, was a
common material or thing which is available anywhere in the market or at
every household. Further, there was no investigation to link the rope
recovered with the crime as no report concerning the forensic aspects of the
fiber or any recovered strands are part of the record. Therefore, the major
condition for application of Section 27 of the Evidence Act was not fulfilled.

(v) Therefore, set aside the orders passed by the trial Court as well as by the
High Court and acquit the Accused from all charges. [23]",,,,

1. Leave granted.
2 . The present appeals are filed by the State having been aggrieved by the common
judgment and order dated 29th January, 2018 passed by the High Court of Punjab and
Haryana, allowing the applications for suspension of sentence, preferred by the
Accused-Respondents herein Under Section 389 Code of Criminal Procedure and
directing to release them on bail, while the Appeals are pending in the High Court.
3 . In order to appreciate the merits of these appeals, brief facts which have emerged
from the case of the prosecution need to be noted at the outset. In all these appeals,
the Accused-Respondents were apprehended with ""manufactured drugs"" and convicted
by the Trial Court for offences committed Under Section 21 or Section 22 of the Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (hereinafter referred to as ""N.D.P.S.
Act""). The alleged offences and conviction recorded by the Trial Court against the
Respondents are listed below:
4 . Aggrieved by the judgment and conviction by the respective Trial Courts, the
Accused-Respondents approached the High Court through various appeals. The
Accused-Respondents, during the pendency of the appeals, preferred an application
seeking suspension of sentence. Since a common question of law was involved in the
above appeals, the High Court heard the matters together and passed a common order
dated 29.01.2018, allowing the applications for suspension of sentence preferred by the
Accused-Respondents. The High Court observed that manufactured drugs, be it
containing narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances, if manufactured by a
manufacturer, must be tried, if violation is there, under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act
and not under the NDPS Act, except those in loose form by way of powder, liquid etc.
Dissatisfied by the above order dated 29.01.2018, the State has preferred the present
appeals.
5 . The counsel on behalf of the Appellant-State, while criticizing the impugned order
passed by the High Court, drew our attention to the relevant provisions of the N.D.P.S.
Act and Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and submitted that, the N.D.P.S. Act, itself
does not bar the application of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. Further, the counsel
also argued that, the impugned judgment is in gross violation of the decision rendered
i n Inderjeet Singh v. State of Punjab MANU/PH/2353/2014 : 2014 (3) RCR
(Criminal) 953, by the Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The
counsel also relied upon the decision rendered by this Court in Union of India v.
Sanjeev V. Deshpande MANU/SC/0688/2014 : (2014) 13 SCC 1, wherein it was
clearly held that dealing in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances is permissible
only if it is for medical or scientific purposes. But even the usage for medical and
scientific purposes is not restriction free, as it is subject to Rules under the N.D.P.S.
Act.
6 . On the contrary, the counsel on behalf of the Accused-Respondents has supported
the reasoning of the High Court while stating that it is very farfetched to presume that,
any person who is apprehended with bulk quantity of manufactured drug, without
having a license for the same, has committed an offence which is liable to be
prosecuted under the N.D.P.S. Act. The counsel further submitted that, the High Court
was correct to conclude that, it can be considered as a violation of the provisions of the
Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. Therefore, there was no error in granting the relief of
suspension of sentence, considering that the appeals are not going to be adjudicated in
the near future.
7. Heard the learned Counsel for both the parties.
8. At the outset it is essential to note the objectives of the two legislations before us,
i.e., the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and the N.D.P.S. Act. The Drugs and Cosmetics
Act, 1940 was enacted to specifically prevent sub-standard drugs and to maintain high
standards of medical treatment. (See Chimanlal Jagjivandas Sheth v. State of
Maharashtra MANU/SC/0145/1962 : AIR 1963 SC 665) The Drugs and Cosmetics Act,
1940 was mainly intended to curtail the menace of adulteration of drugs and also of
production, manufacture, distribution and sale of spurious and sub-standard drugs. On
the other hand, the N.D.P.S. Act is a special law enacted by the Parliament with an
object to control and regulate the operations relating to narcotic drugs and psychotropic
substances. After analyzing the objectives of both the Acts, we can safely conclude that
while the Drugs and Cosmetics Act deals with drugs which are intended to be used for
therapeutic or medicinal usage, on the other hand the N.D.P.S. Act intends to curb and
penalize the usage of drugs which are used for intoxication or for getting a stimulant
effect.
9. At this juncture, it is also pertinent to note the relevant provisions under the N.D.P.S.
Act. Section 8 of the 1985 Act, is the prohibitory Clause whose violation would lead to
penal consequence:
Section 8. Prohibition of certain operations.
-No person shall-
(a) cultivate any coca plant or gather any portion of coca plant; or
(b) cultivate the opium poppy or any cannabis plant; or
(c) produce, manufacture, possess, sell, purchase, transport,
warehouse, use, consume, import inter-State, export inter State, import
into India, export from India or transship any narcotic drug or
psychotropic substance,
except for medical or scientific purposes and in the manner and to the
extent provided by the provisions of this Act or the Rules or orders
made thereunder and in a case where any such provision, imposes any
requirement by way of licence, permit or authorization also in
accordance with the terms and conditions of such licence, permit or
authorization:
Provided that, and subject to the other provisions of this Act
and the Rules made there under, the prohibition against the
cultivation of the cannabis plant for the production of ganja or
the production, possession, use, consumption, purchase, sale,
transport, warehousing, import inter-State and export inter
State of ganja for any purpose other than medical and scientific
purpose shall take effect only from the date which the Central
Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify
in this behalf.
1 0 . Further, Section 21 provides for punishment for contraventions in relation to
manufactured drugs and preparations and Section 22 provides for punishment for
contraventions in relation to psychotropic substances. Both the above provisions
provide for the imposition of rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less
than ten years but which may extend to twenty years, and the imposition of a fine which
shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may be extended to two lakh rupees, if
the recovered substance amounts to commercial quantity. However, the proviso
appended thereto empowers the Court, with a discretionary power to impose a fine
exceeding two lakh rupees for reasons to be recorded in the judgment.
11. In the present case, the Accused-Respondents were found in bulk possession of
manufactured drugs without any valid authorization. The counsel on behalf of the
Appellant-State has extensively stressed that the actions of the Accused-Respondents
amounts to clear violation of Section 8 of the N.D.P.S. Act as it clearly prohibits
possession of narcotic substances except for medicinal or scientific purposes. In
furtherance of the same, the counsel on behalf of the Appellant-State has put emphasis
on the judgment rendered by this Court in the case of Union of India v. Sanjeev V.
Deshpande (supra), wherein it was held that:
25. In other words, DEALING IN narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances is
permissible only when such DEALING is for medical purposes or scientific
purposes. Further, the mere fact that the DEALING IN narcotic drugs
and psychotropic substances is for a medical or scientific purpose does
not by itself lift the embargo created Under Section 8(c). Such a dealing
must be in the manner and extent provided by the provisions of the Act, Rules
or Orders made thereunder. Sections 9 and 10 enable the Central and the State
Governments respectively to make Rules permitting and regulating various
aspects (contemplated Under Section 8(c), of DEALING IN narcotic drugs and
psychotropic substances.
26. The Act does not contemplate framing of Rules for prohibiting the various
activities of DEALING IN narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. Such
prohibition is already contained in Section 8(c). It only contemplates of the
framing of Rules for permitting and regulating any activity of DEALING
IN narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances....
12. In the present appeals before us, the trial courts after analyzing the evidence placed
before them, held the Accused Respondents guilty beyond reasonable doubt and
convicted them for offences committed Under Section 21 and Section 22 of the N.D.P.S.
Act.
13. The counsels for the Accused-Respondents have strongly supported the judgment of
the High Court wherein it was held that, since the present matters deal with
""manufactured drugs"" the present Respondents should be tried for the violation of
provisions of Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.
14. However, we are unable to agree on the conclusion reached by the High Court for
reasons stated further. First, we note that Section 80 of the N.D.P.S. Act, clearly lays
down that application of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act is not barred, and provisions of
N.D.P.S. Act can be applicable in addition to that of the provisions of the Drugs and
Cosmetics Act. The statute further clarifies that the provisions of the N.D.P.S. Act are
not in derogation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. This Court in the case of
Union of India v. Sanjeev V. Deshpande (supra), has held that,
3 5 . ...essentially the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 deals with various
operations of manufacture, sale, purchase etc. of drugs generally whereas
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 deals with a
more specific class of drugs and, therefore, a special law on the
subject. Further the provisions of the Act operate in addition to the provisions
of 1940 Act.
15. The aforesaid decision further clarifies that, the N.D.P.S. Act, should not be read in
exclusion to Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. Additionally, it is the prerogative of the
State to prosecute the offender in accordance with law. In the present case, since the
action of the Accused-Respondents amounted to a prima-facie violation of Section 8 of
the N.D.P.S. Act, they were charged Under Section 22 of the N.D.P.S. Act.
16. In light of above observations, we find that decision rendered by the High Court
holding that the Accused-Respondents must be tried under the Drugs and Cosmetics
Act, 1940 instead of the N.D.P.S. Act, as they were found in possession of the
""manufactured drugs"", does not hold good in law. Further, in the present case, the
Accused-Respondents had approached the High Court seeking suspension of sentence.
However, in granting the aforesaid relief, the High Court erroneously made observations
on the merits of the case while the appeals were still pending before it.
1 7 . Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case and the gravity of
offence alleged against the Accused-Respondents, the order of the High Court directing
suspension of sentence and grant of bail is clearly unsustainable in law and the same is
liable to be set aside.
18. Accordingly the impugned order passed by the High Court is hereby set aside and
the concerned authorities are directed to take the Accused-Respondents herein into
custody forthwith.
1 9 . Lastly, the counsels for Respondents in Appeals arising out of SLP (Crl.) No.
4816/2018 and SLP (Crl.) No. 4817/2018 have specifically pleaded that the
Respondents have already undergone a considerable period under incarceration. In light
of the same, we request the High Court to expedite the hearings and dispose of the
appeals accordingly. It is needless to observe that the observations made during the
course of this order are only for deciding these appeals.
20. The appeals stand allowed in aforesaid terms. As a sequel pending applications, if
any shall also stand disposed of.","Appellants: State of Punjab

CRIMINAL MATTERS - CRIMINAL MATTERS RELATING TO SUSPENSION OF SENTENCE
Facts:
Accused-Respondents were apprehended with ""manufactured drugs"" and
convicted by Trial Court for offences committed under Section 21 or Section
22 of NDPS Act. Accused-Respondents approached High Court through various
Appeals. Accused-Respondents, during pendency of Appeals, filed an
application seeking suspension of sentence. Since a common question of law
was involved in above Appeals, High Court heard matters together and passed
a common order allowing Applications for suspension of sentence preferred by
Accused-Respondents. High Court observed that manufactured drugs, be it
containing narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances, if manufactured by a
manufacturer, must be tried, if violation was there, under 1940 Act and not
under NDPS Act, except those in loose form by way of powder, liquid etc.
Hence present Appeals.
Held: While allowing the appeals
Section 80 of NDPS Act, clearly laid down that Application of 1940 Act was
not barred, and provisions of NDPS Act could be applicable in addition to that
of provisions of 1940 Act. Statute further clarified that provisions of NDPS Act
were not in derogation of Act 1940.[14]
It was prerogative of State to prosecute offender in accordance with law. In
present case, since action of Accused-Respondents amounted to a prima-facie
violation of Section 8 of NDPS Act, they were charged under Section 22 of
NDPS Act.[15]
Decision rendered by High Court holding that Accused-Respondents must be
tried under 1940 Act, instead of NDPS Act, as they were found in possession
of ""manufactured drugs"", did not hold good in law. Further, in present case,
Accused-Respondents had approached High Court seeking suspension of
sentence. However, in granting aforesaid relief, High Court erroneously made

Accordingly impugned order passed by High Court was set aside and

2 . The instant appeals have been filed against the final common judgment and order
dated 16.02.2015 of the High Court of Bombay in Confirmation Case No. 3 of 2014 with
Criminal Appeal No. 760 of 2014 whereby the learned High Court confirmed the death
sentence awarded to the Appellant herein.
By the impugned judgment, the High Court dismissed the aforementioned confirmation
case and criminal appeal arising out of the judgment and order of conviction and
sentence dated 25.06.2014 of the Additional Sessions Judge, Mangaon, Raigad, in
Sessions Case No. 8 of 2013. The Sessions Court had convicted the Appellant Viran
Gyanlal Rajput for the offences punishable Under Sections 302 and 201 of the Indian
Penal Code, and Under Sections 10 and 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual
Offences Act, 2012 (""POCSO Act"") for the kidnapping, rape and murder of a 13-year-old
girl, and causing disappearance of evidence. The Appellant was sentenced to death for
the offence Under Section 302, Indian Penal Code; R.I. for 10 years and a fine of Rs.
200 (1 year's R.I. in default) Under Section 366, Indian Penal Code; R.I. for 7 years and
a fine of Rs. 200 (1 year's R.I. in default) Under Section 10, POCSO Act; imprisonment
for life and a fine of Rs. 500 (2 years' R.I. in default) Under Section 4, POCSO Act; and
R.I. for 7 years and a fine of Rs. 200 (1 year's R.I. in default) Under Section 201, Indian
Penal Code. Except for overturning the Appellant's conviction Under Section 10, POCSO
Act, lacking a specific charge for the same, the judgment and order of conviction and
sentence rendered by the Sessions Court was maintained by the High Court.
3. The case for the prosecution in brief is that on 17.10.2012, when the victim did not
return home from school at the usual time in the evening, a search was undertaken. The
next day, some of her belongings were found in the jungle area adjoining the village. A
complaint (Exh. 14) regarding missing of the girl was lodged around 8.30 a.m. by PW3,
Samir Parab, the victim's cousin. In the meantime, PW4, Vijay Parab, the victim's uncle,
who had seen the victim being followed the last evening on the way back from school
by an unknown person wearing a red T-shirt, and PW5 Abhijit Chavan (a resident of the
neighbouring Toranpada village), who had later seen the same person running towards
Toranpada village, went to the adjoining settlement of Paradhis (a nomadic community)
along with some other villagers, suspecting him to be there. The person, none other
than the Appellant herein, was apprehended by the villagers and was being brought to
Avandhe village (a neighbouring area). At that time, they were accosted by the police
who were proceeding to undertake investigation with respect to the missing person's
complaint. The police thereupon took custody of the Appellant. Around this time, the
first information pertaining to the offence of murder was given to the police by PW3.
The dead body of the victim was recovered in a naked condition, at the instance of the
Appellant, from a field near Kamthekarwadi village (the village where the victim
resided) and subsequently her clothes were recovered at his instance as well.
As per the post mortem report (Exh. 35) and the evidence of the doctor who conducted
it (PW13), the probable cause of death was opined as asphyxia with cardio-respiratory
arrest due to strangulation. It was also found that the deceased had been forcibly
subjected to sexual intercourse.
4 . The Trial Court as well as the High Court found the following incriminating
circumstances against the Appellant, namely, the deceased was last seen with him while
she was walking home from school; the Appellant was seen running alone towards
Toranpada later in the evening; the recovery of the dead body and incriminating articles
(importantly, the clothes of the victim) at the instance of the Appellant; mud stains on
the pants of the Appellant which matched with the mud seized from the spot of recovery
of the victim's body; failure of the Appellant to explain injuries found on him; medical
evidence showing that the victim had been forcibly raped and killed; motive to gratify
lust, and to kill the victim and hide her body to suppress evidence of his crime; and the
failure of the Appellant to offer a plausible explanation for the incriminating
circumstances against him. Importantly, both the Courts relied on the testimony of PW
Nos. 4 and 5 as last seen witnesses.
5. Heard the counsel on either side.
6 . Shri V. Giri, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant, duly assisted by
Shri Amartiya Kanjilal, Advocate, submitted that the chain of circumstantial evidence
had not been established satisfactorily by the prosecution. He argued that the recoveries
made at the instance of the Appellant were inadmissible. According to him, the 'last
seen' principle was incorrectly applied, as none out of PWs 3-5 had actually seen the
deceased in the company of the Appellant--rather, PW4 had only seen him following the
deceased at a distance, and PW5 had seen him in the morning in the vicinity and shown
him the way to Pedali (a nearby village, where the victim went to school) and later seen
him running towards Toranpada, alone. Furthermore, the identification of the Appellant
was based on the precarious grounds of wearing a red T-shirt and having mud stains on
his pants, instead of through a Test Identification Parade. It was also submitted that the
injuries in the form of scratch marks found on the Appellant could not be interpreted as
having been inflicted by the deceased in her defence: firstly, because as per the
evidence of the doctor who examined the Appellant (PW12), the injuries had taken place
within 24 hours preceding the examination, well after the alleged time of the incident
(i.e. the evening/night of 17.10.2012), which fact also suggested that they probably
took place during the manhandling of the Appellant by the villagers upon apprehending
him (as also evident from PW12's admission that the injuries were possible in a scuffle
if the injured fell on a rough object), and secondly, because as per the FSL Report being
Exh. 38, there was no blood detected on the fingernail clippings of the deceased, which
would not have been the case if she had indeed inflicted the scratches. Learned Counsel
for the Appellant also submitted that the non-naming of the Appellant and nonmentioning
of the Crime Number in the inquest report (Exh. 40) and the nonexplanation
of the discovery and ownership of a second watch recovered from near the
spot of the body was suspicious. At the same time, as the vaginal swabs of the victim
did not indicate the presence of semen even after 3 samples were taken (as per the FSL
Report being Exh. 38, read with the evidence of the doctor PW13), nothing remained to
tie the Appellant to the commission of the crime.
On the issue of sentencing, learned Counsel argued that the Appellant was only 22
years old at the time of the offence, had dependents in the form of his wife and two
young children, lacked criminal antecedents, and had shown good behaviour post his
incarceration, and therefore the death penalty was not warranted.
7 . Per contra, Shri Nishant Ramakantrao Katneshwarkar, learned Counsel for the
Respondent-State of Maharashtra, stressed that the chain of circumstance had been
established beyond reasonable doubt. The body of the victim as well as her articles had
been recovered only at the behest of the Accused, and he had been seen following the
girl by PW4 and later running towards Toranpada by PW5. He submitted that the
identification of the Appellant could not be assailed, since the village merely consisted
of 25 houses, and thus the witnesses had immediately identified that the person was an
outsider, and went to search among the nomadic Paradhi community as their settlement
was located only 3 km outside the village, since they felt that it was probable that the
unidentified person belonged thereto. Furthermore, the mud stains on the pants of the
Appellant were highly incriminating, because as per the FSL Report being Exh. 62, they
matched in composition and characteristics with the mud seized from the spot of
recovery of the deceased's body. Lastly, he submitted that the non-explanation
regarding the second watch could not be considered fatal to the case of the prosecution
at all.
On the issue of sentencing, learned Counsel for the State submitted that the Court keep
in mind the plight and helplessness of the victim and her parents.
8. We have perused the evidence on record carefully, as well as the judgments of the
Trial Court and the High Court.
To begin with, we find that the Trial Court and the High Court were correct in relying
upon the testimony of PWs 4 and 5, which is natural and reliable. PW4 Vijay Parab was
the victim's uncle, and PW5 Abhijit Chavan was a resident of the neighbouring
Toranpada village. PW4 testified that he saw the victim being followed by a person in a
red T-shirt, being the Appellant, while she was on the way home from school on the
evening of the incident. He also stated that he had asked the victim if she was going
home alone, to which she had answered in the affirmative. PW5 testified that a person
in a red T-shirt, being the Accused before the trial Court, had asked him the way to
Pedali village on the morning of the incident, at Toranpada village, and he had seen the
same person running alone, with his pants muddied, towards Toranpada in the evening
around 6-6.30 p.m., at a spot which was later found to be around 300m from the spot
of recovery of the victim's body.
The presence of these witnesses at the relevant points of time is also natural. PW4 was
proceeding on a tractor from Kamthekarwadi to Pedali when he met the victim on her
way back from school proceeding in the opposite direction. PW5, on the other hand,
had been asked the way to Pedali by the Appellant on the morning of the incident, while
he was at his house in Toranpada, and had seen the same person again in the evening,
running towards Toranpada, while he was grazing his cattle near Awandhe.
PWs 4 and 5 also testified to being part of the party of villagers that undertook to
search the Paradhi settlement for the person in the red T-shirt when it was discovered
that the victim had gone missing, and apprehended the Appellant therefrom, handing
him over to the police, who they met on the way to Avandhe village. We are of the
opinion that the conduct of these witnesses appears natural, as it would have been
reasonable for them to search the nearest settlement, when it was realised that the
victim was last seen being followed by an outsider. As rightly contended by counsel for
the prosecution, in a village of merely 25 houses, where everyone is well-acquainted
with one another, an outsider would stand out starkly, and attract attention. In such a
situation, his identification through clothes, if supported by the testimony of multiple
witnesses whose testimony has been found to inspire confidence, cannot be found fault
with only because a Test Identification Parade was not conducted subsequently.
The testimony of the witnesses as referred to above is corroborated by PW3, Samir
Parab, who is a cousin of the victim and also the informant in this case. He testified that
when the search for the victim was undertaken, PW 4 told him about seeing a person in
a red T-shirt with the victim. The adjacent jungle area was searched, and around 3 am
in the morning her sandal was recovered around 200m to the east of Kamthekarwadi
village, and in the morning her schoolbag as well as a wristwatch given to her by PW3
himself, were discovered, after which he proceeded to lodge a missing person's report.
Subsequently, on his way to Avandhe with the police, he met PWs 4 and 5 in a group of
villagers with the Appellant, who was handed over to the police.
Furthermore, the testimony of PWs 3, 4 and 5 is also consistent on the point that after
the Appellant was handed over to the custody of the police, he gave a statement to
them and led them to the spot where the body of the victim was hidden, i.e. a field
owned by one Raghunath Deshmukh, around 300m away from Kamthekarwadi village.
This field was overgrown with grass, and the Appellant revealed the body by keeping
aside grass and mud. The body was buried about 2 feet under the ground. The body
was in a naked condition with a red odhani (dupatta) tied around the neck. This is also
corroborated by the evidence of PW8, one of the panchas, and PW14, the I.O., who also
testified that articles such as the earrings of the deceased, her schoolbag containing her
ID card, books and notebooks, as well as two wristwatches were also found on the
spot.
In this situation, we also find that the minor discrepancies in the recorded timings and
sequence of events pertaining to the recovery of the body, and articles including the
victim's schoolbag, as evident through the First Information Statement (Exh. 63), the
testimony of the I.O., PW14, and the spot panchanama (Ex. 23), are not fatal to the
prosecution version and may be explained due to all the events happening in quick
succession, viz. the apprehending of the Appellant, the recovery of the dead body, the
lodging of the FIR pertaining to murder and the preparation of the spot panchanama.
Moreover, the argument that the recovery of the dead body at the instance of the
Appellant is highly suspicious cannot be sustained either, since it is clear from the
testimony of the witnesses that the body was recovered from a spot which could only
have been within the knowledge of the person who hid the body to begin with. This is
also fortified by the lack of any explanation by the Appellant regarding the recovery of
the body and the circumstance of the victim being last seen around him. To add to this,
even the clothes of the deceased were recovered at the instance of the Appellant, from a
spot around 200m from Kamthekarwadi, from a pit which had been covered with a
stone. This again is a location of which only the perpetrator of the offence could have
had knowledge. Although it is true that the recovery of articles is to be made based on
the statement of the Accused immediately after the arrest of the Accused and recording
his statement, the recovery should be based on the voluntary action relating to showing
of the place by the Accused. Therefore, unless the Accused volunteers to show the place
of hiding certain things/facts, the recovery cannot be made by the investigating officers.
In this view of the matter, if the Accused volunteered to show the place where he had
hidden the deceased's clothes at a particular place only after 5 days, the investigating
officer cannot be blamed for the same. In a given case, the Accused may confess ten or
fifteen days after his arrest and as such the recovery cannot be suspected on this
ground alone. Together, these circumstances establish that the Appellant had hidden the
body of the deceased, as well as her clothes, in a bid to suppress the evidence of his
crime.
The matching of the mud recovered from the spot of recovery of the victim's body with
the mud stains on the pants of the Appellant is also highly incriminating, as rightly held
by the Trial Court and the High Court.
As regards the scratch marks found on the face and neck of the Accused, we have
considered the argument of the Appellant that it was possible for the injuries to have
been inflicted during the scuffle that would have ensued at the time that the party of
villagers apprehended the Appellant, even though the medical evidence given by PW13
also shows that they could have been inflicted by a woman resisting sexual assault. It is
the defence of the Appellant that 10 to 15 villagers who went to the Paradhi settlement
in search of the Accused wearing a red T-shirt must have caught hold of the Accused
and assaulted him mercilessly, consequent to which the Accused sustained scratch
marks on his body. Such explanation on behalf of the Accused cannot be accepted,
inasmuch as a total of 8 injuries have been sustained by the Accused, out of which 7
are scratch marks and only 1 is a contusion. If really the Accused was assaulted
mercilessly by 10 to 15 villagers, at least 10 to 15 contusions or abrasions etc. should
have been found on the body of the Accused. On the other hand, the scratch marks
suffered by the Appellant are of such a nature as would generally occur while a victim
resists any illegal action by such person such as rape etc. Such scratch marks are
generally inflicted by nails. Since the victim was unarmed, she must have resisted the
assault on her by the Accused, leading to scratches on the Accused. Thus, the scratch
marks found on his face and neck clearly show the resistance of the victim.
The medical evidence also clearly establishes the occurrence of rape. As per the
evidence of PW13 and the post mortem report (Exh. 35), there was swelling in the
victim's labia majora along with multiple tears in the hymen. Additionally, there were
several scratch marks all over her body. As regards the murder of the victim, the
evidence of PW13 indicates that she was killed by strangulation by the red odhani which
was found tied tightly around the victim's neck when her body was recovered.
The motive for the crime, i.e. lust, is also apparent, which is an important consideration
in cases based on circumstantial evidence, as pointed out by the High Court. No doubt,
the semen of the Appellant has not been detected in the vaginal swabs of the deceased
(as per the FSL Report being Exh. 38), having been found only on the knickers of the
Appellant himself (as per the FSL Report being Exh. 61). However, this, too, cannot be
a ground to exonerate the Appellant, given the totality of circumstances of the case, and
also considering that the swabs were mixed with mud, as stated by the doctor PW13.
Additionally, in light of the incriminating circumstances enumerated above, we find
ourselves unable to agree with the contention of the learned Senior Counsel for the
Appellant that the non-investigation into the ownership of the second wristwatch
recovered vitiates the case against the Accused. Moreover, as noted by the High Court,
the non-seizure of the sandal of the victim and the stone used to hide the victim's
clothes, also does not strike at the root of the matter.
9. Thus, we are of the opinion that each link in the chain of circumstantial evidence has
been adequately established by the prosecution, and the conviction of the Appellant is
affirmed.
10. We now turn our attention to the issue of quantum of sentence, particularly the
sentence of death awarded to the Appellant. Before proceeding further, it would be
pertinent to recall that life imprisonment is the Rule and the death penalty is the
exception, and the death penalty is to be imposed only when the alternative of life
imprisonment is totally inadequate, and therefore unquestionably foreclosed, i.e. if it is
the only inevitable conclusion, as per the well-settled legal proposition first enunciated
i n Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, MANU/SC/0055/1982 : (1980) 2 SCC 684.
While determining the sentence, it is equally important for the Court to consider the
aggravating circumstances of the crime and the mitigating circumstances of the
criminal. Moreover, since the decision in Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab,
MANU/SC/0211/1983 : (1983) 3 SCC 470, a balancing approach of such aggravating
and mitigating circumstances has been adopted, to see if the crime is among the rarest
of rare cases.
The Trial Court and the High Court, on an evaluation of the aggravating and mitigating
circumstances of the case, have arrived at the conclusion that the death sentence is
warranted in this case. Undoubtedly, the Courts were correct in giving weight to the
dastardly nature and manner of the crime, i.e. kidnapping a girl of the tender age of 13
years, taking her to a secluded area and committing the act of rape and subsequently
murdering her by strangulation and burying her body in a field, having disrobed her
completely, and also in giving weight to the youth and helplessness of the victim, and
to the fact that the Appellant proceeded to target her to satisfy his lust.
Though we agree that the crime committed is of an abominable nature, it cannot be said
to be of such a brutal, depraved, heinous or diabolical nature so as to fall into the
category of the rarest of rare cases and invite punishment with death. We also find
ourselves unable to agree with the view of the Courts that the Appellant is such a
menace to society that he cannot be allowed to stay alive.
On the other hand, we are of the view that the prosecution did not establish that the
Appellant was beyond reform, especially given his young age. We are also mindful of
the Appellant's lack of criminal antecedents prior to the commission of this crime, and
of his post incarceration conduct, which in no way suggests the impossibility of his
reform. It would be pertinent to observe at this point that although the Trial Court noted
his lack of remorse during the hearing, and the High Court noted his lack of remorse
after committing the crime, as he was found calmly wandering around the locality, this
does not in any way indicate that there is no scope of reform for the Appellant.
11. Thus, neither the circumstances of the crime nor the circumstances of the criminal,
i.e. the Appellant, would go to show that the instant matter falls into the category of the
rarest of rare cases, or that the sentence of life imprisonment is unquestionably
foreclosed and grossly disproportionate. Therefore, in the totality of the facts and
circumstances of this case, we find it fit to commute the death sentence of the Appellant
to life imprisonment.
At the same time, we are of the opinion that a sentence of life imprisonment simpliciter
would not be proportionate to the gravity of the offence committed, and would not meet
the need to respond to crimes against women and children in the most stringent manner
possible. Moreover, though we have noticed above that the possibility of reform of the
Accused is not completely precluded, we nevertheless share the concerns of the Trial
Court and the High Court regarding the lack of remorse on behalf of the Appellant and
the possibility of reoffending. In such a situation, we deem it fit to restrict the right of
the Appellant to claim remission in his sentence of life imprisonment for a period of 20
years.
12. At this juncture, we would like to acknowledge and appreciate the diligence and
painstaking attention to detail in preparing for this matter on the part of Shri Amartiya
Kanjilal, learned Counsel for the Appellant, as also commended by Shri V. Giri, learned
Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant.
1 3 . Thus, the Criminal Appeals arising from Special Leave Petition (Criminal) Nos.
5416-17 of 2015 are disposed of by commuting the sentence of death awarded to the
Appellant to life imprisonment, out of which the Appellant shall mandatorily serve out a
minimum of 20 years without claiming remission.","Appellants: Viran Gyanlal Rajput

Facts:
Case for prosecution in brief was that, when victim did not return home from
school at usual time in evening, a search was undertaken. Next day, some of
her belongings were found in jungle area adjoining village. A complaint (Exh.
14) regarding missing of girl was lodged. First information pertaining to
offence of murder was given to police. Trial Court as well as High Court found
following incriminating circumstances against Appellant, namely, deceased
was last seen with him while she was walking home from school; Appellant
was seen running alone towards Toranpada later in evening; recovery of dead
body and incriminating articles (importantly, clothes of victim) at instance of
Appellant; mud stains on pants of Appellant which matched with mud seized
from spot of recovery of victim's body; failure of Appellant to explain injuries
found on him; medical evidence showing that, victim had been forcibly raped
and killed; motive to gratify lust, and to kill victim and hide her body to
suppress evidence of his crime; and failure of Appellant to offer a plausible
explanation for incriminating circumstances against him. Sessions Court had
convicted Appellant for offences punishable under Sections 302 and 201 of
IPC, and under Sections 10 and 4 of POCSO Act for kidnapping, rape and
murder of a 13-year-old girl, and causing disappearance of evidence.
Held, while disposing of the appeal
1. Trial Court and High Court were correct in relying upon testimony of PWs 4
and 5, which was natural and reliable. Minor discrepancies in recorded
timings and sequence of events pertaining to recovery of body, and articles
including victim's schoolbag, as evident through First Information Statement
(Exh. 63), testimony of I.O., PW14, and spot panchanama (Ex. 23), were not
fatal to prosecution version and may be explained due to all events happening
in quick succession, viz. apprehending of Appellant, recovery of dead body,
lodging of FIR pertaining to murder and preparation of spot panchanama.
Moreover, argument that recovery of dead body at instance of Appellant was
highly suspicious could not be sustained, since it was clear from testimony of
witnesses that body was recovered from a spot which could only have been
within knowledge of person who hid body to begin with. This was also
fortified by lack of any explanation by Appellant regarding recovery of body
and circumstance of victim being last seen around him. Medical evidence also
clearly established occurrence of rape. Additionally, there were several
scratch marks all over her body. As regards murder of victim, evidence of
PW13 indicated that, she was killed by strangulation by red odhani which was
found tied tightly around victim's neck when her body was recovered. Motive
for crime, i.e. lust, was also apparent, which was an important consideration
in cases based on circumstantial evidence, as pointed out by High Court. [8]
2. Thus, each link in chain of circumstantial evidence had been adequately
established by prosecution, and conviction of Appellant was affirmed. [9]
3. Life imprisonment was Rule and death penalty was exception, and death
penalty was to be imposed only when alternative of life imprisonment was
totally inadequate, and therefore unquestionably foreclosed, i.e. if it was only
inevitable conclusion, as per well-settled legal proposition first enunciated in
Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab. While determining sentence, it was equally
important for Court to consider aggravating circumstances of crime and
mitigating circumstances of criminal. Moreover, since decision in Machhi
Singh v. State of Punjab, a balancing approach of such aggravating and
mitigating circumstances had been adopted, to see if crime was among rarest
of rare cases. Though, crime committed was of an abominable nature, it could
not be said to be of such a brutal, depraved, heinous or diabolical nature so as
to fall into category of rarest of rare cases and invite punishment with death.
Prosecution did not establish that, Appellant was beyond reform, especially
given his young age. A sentence of life imprisonment simpliciter would not be
proportionate to gravity of offence committed, and would not meet need to
respond to crimes against women and children in most stringent manner
possible. Possibility of reform of Accused was not completely precluded. In
such a situation, it was deemed fit to restrict right of Appellant to claim
remission in his sentence of life imprisonment for a period of 20 years. [10]
4. Thus, Criminal Appeals were disposed of by commuting sentence of death
awarded to Appellant to life imprisonment, out of which Appellant shall
mandatorily serve out a minimum of 20 years without claiming remission.

Ratio Decidendi: Death penalty was to be imposed only when alternative of

"A.K. Sikri, J.
1. The instant writ petition filed by the Petitioners Under Article 32 of the Constitution
of India raises important issues touching upon the efficacy of the criminal justice
system in this country. In an adversarial system, which is prevalent by India, the court
is supposed to decide the cases on the basis of evidence produced before it. This
evidence can be in the form of documents. It can be oral evidence as well, i.e., the
deposition of witnesses. The witnesses, thus, play a vital role in facilitating the court to
arrive at correct findings on disputed questions of facts and to find out where the truth
lies. They are, therefore, backbone in decision making process. Whenever, in a dispute,
the two sides come out with conflicting version, the witnesses become important tool to
arrive at right conclusions, thereby advancing justice in a matter. This principle applies
with more vigor and strength in criminal cases inasmuch as most of such cases are
decided on the basis of testimonies of the witnesses, particularly, eye-witnesses, who
may have seen actual occurrence/crime. It is for this reason that Bentham stated more
than 150 years ago that ""witnesses are eyes and ears of justice"".
2. Thus, witnesses are important players in the judicial system, who help the judges in
arriving at correct factual findings. The instrument of evidence is the medium through
which facts, either disputed or required to be proved, are effectively conveyed to the
courts. This evidence in the form of documentary and oral is given by the witnesses. A
witness may be a partisan or interested witness, i.e., a witness who is in a near relation
with the victim of crime or is concerned with conviction of the Accused person. Even his
testimony is relevant, though, stricter scrutiny is required while adjudging the credence
of such a victim. However, apart from these witnesses or the witnesses who may
themselves be the victims, other witnesses may not have any personal interest in the
outcome of a case. They still help the judicial system. In the words of Whittaker
Chambers, a witness is ""a man whose life and faith are so completely one that when
the challenge comes to step out and testify for his faith, he does so, disregarding all
risks, accepting all consequences1.""
3. The importance of the witness, particularly in a criminal trial is highlighted in a book
in the following manner:
In search of truth, he plays that sacred role of the sun, which eliminates the
darkness of ignorance and illuminates the face of justice, encircled by devils of
humanity and compassion.
xxx xxx xxx
The value of witnesses can't be denied, keeping in view the dependency of the
criminal proceedings on the testimonies and cooperation of witnesses in all the
stages of the proceedings, especially in those cases where the prosecution has
to establish the guilt with absolute certainty via oral cross-examination of
witnesses in hearings open to the world at large. In such cases, the testimony
of a witness, even if not as an eye witness, may prove to be crucial in
determining the circumstances in which the crime might have been
committed....2
Notwithstanding the same, the conditions of witnesses in Indian Legal System can be
termed as 'pathetic'. There are many threats faced by the witnesses at various stages of
an investigation and then during the trial of a case. Apart from facing life threatening
intimidation to himself and to his relatives, he may have to face the trauma of attending
the court regularly. Because of the lack of Witness Protection Programme in India and
the treatment that is meted out to them, there is a tendency of reluctance in coming
forward and making statement during the investigation and/or testify in courts. These
witnesses neither have any legal remedy nor do they get suitably treated. The present
legal system takes witnesses completely for granted. They are summoned to court
regardless of their financial and personal conditions. Many times they are made to
appear long after the incident of the alleged crime, which significantly hampers their
ability to recall necessary details at the time of actual crime. They are not even suitably
remunerated for the loss of time and the expenditure towards conveyance etc.
4. In Swaran Singh v. State of Punjab MANU/SC/0320/2000 : (2000) 5 SCC 68 at
678, this Court speaking through Wadhwa, J. expressed view on conditions of witnesses
by stating that:
The witnesses are harassed a lot. They come from distant places and see the
case is adjourned. They have to attend the court many times on their own. It
has become routine that case is adjourned till the witness is tired and will stop
coming to court. In this process lawyers also play an important role. Sometimes
witness is threatened, maimed, or even bribed. There is no protection to the
witnesses. By adjourning the case the court also becomes a party to such
miscarriage of justice. The witness is not given respect by the court. They are
pulled out of the court room by the peon. After waiting for the whole day he
sees the matter being adjourned. There is no proper place for him to sit and
drink a glass of water. When he appears, he is subjected to prolong stretched
examinations and cross examinations. For these reasons persons avoid
becoming a witness and because of this administration of justice are hampered.
The witnesses are not paid money within time. The High Courts must be vigilant
in these matters and should avoid harassment in these matters by subordinate
staff. The witnesses should be paid immediately irrespective of the fact whether
he examines or the matter is adjourned. The time has come now that all courts
should be linked with each other through computer. The Bar Council of India
has to play important role in this process to put the criminal justice system on
track. Though the trial judge is aware that witness is telling lie still he is not
ready to file complaint against such witness because he is required to sign the
same. There is need to amend Section 340(3)(b) of Code of Criminal Procedure.
5. It hardly needs to be emphasised that one of the main reasons for witnesses to turn
hostile is that they are not accorded appropriate protection by the State. It is a harsh
reality, particularly, in those cases where the Accused persons/criminals are tried for
heinous offences, or where the Accused persons are influential persons or in a
dominating position that they make attempts to terrorize or intimidate the witnesses
because of which these witnesses either avoid coming to courts or refrain from
deposing truthfully. This unfortunate situation prevails because of the reason that the
State has not undertaken any protective measure to ensure the safety of these
witnesses, commonly known as 'witness protection'.
6. Over the last many years criminal justice system in this country has been witness to
traumatic experience where witnesses turn hostile. This has been happening very
frequently. There may be many causes for this sordid phenomena.
7 . I n Ramesh and Ors. v. State of Haryana MANU/SC/1517/2016 : (2017) 1 SCC
529, this Court had indicated some of the reasons which make witnesses turn hostile, as
can be discerned from the following discussion.
40. In some of the judgments in past few years, this Court has commented
upon such peculiar behaviour of witnesses turning hostile and we would like to
quote from few such judgments. In Krishna Mochi v. State of Bihar [Krishna
Mochi v. State of Bihar, MANU/SC/0327/2002 : (2002) 6 SCC 81: 2002 SCC
(Cri.) 1220], this Court observed as under: (SCC p. 104, para 31)
31. It is a matter of common experience that in recent times there has
been a sharp decline of ethical values in public life even in developed
countries much less developing one, like ours, where the ratio of
decline is higher. Even in ordinary cases, witnesses are not inclined to
depose or their evidence is not found to be credible by courts for
manifold reasons. One of the reasons may be that they do not have
courage to depose against an Accused because of threats to their life,
more so when the offenders are habitual criminals or high-ups in the
Government or close to powers, which may be political, economic or
other powers including muscle power.
41. Likewise, in Zahira Habibullah Sheikh (5) v. State of Gujarat [Zahira
Habibullah Sheikh (5) v. State of Gujarat, MANU/SC/1344/2006 : (2006) 3 SCC
374: (2006) 2 SCC (Cri.) 8], this Court highlighted the problem with the
following observations: (SCC pp. 396-98, paras 40-41)
40. ""Witnesses"" as Bentham said: ""are the eyes and ears of justice"".
Hence, the importance and primacy of the quality of trial process. If the
witness himself is incapacitated from acting as eyes and ears of justice,
the trial gets putrefied and paralysed, and it no longer can constitute a
fair trial. The incapacitation may be due to several factors, like the
witness being not in a position for reasons beyond control to speak the
truth in the court or due to negligence or ignorance or some corrupt
collusion. Time has become ripe to act on account of numerous
experiences faced by the court on account of frequent turning of
witnesses as hostile, either due to threats, coercion, lures and
monetary considerations at the instance of those in power, their
henchmen and hirelings, political clouts and patronage and
innumerable other corrupt practices ingeniously adopted to smother
and stifle truth and realities coming out to surface.... Broader public
and societal interests require that the victims of the crime who are not
ordinarily parties to prosecution and the interests of the State
represented by their prosecuting agencies do not suffer.... There comes
the need for protecting the witness. Time has come when serious and
undiluted thoughts are to be bestowed for protecting witnesses so that
the ultimate truth presented before the court and justice triumphs and
that the trial is not reduced to a mockery. ...
41. The State has a definite role to play in protecting the witnesses, to
start with at least in sensitive cases involving those in power, who have
political patronage and could wield muscle and money power, to avert
trial getting tainted and derailed and truth becoming a casualty. As a
protector of its citizens it has to ensure that during a trial in court the
witness could safely depose the truth without any fear of being haunted
by those against whom he had deposed. Every State has a
constitutional obligation and duty to protect the life and liberty of its
citizens. That is the fundamental requirement for observance of the
Rule of law. There cannot be any deviation from this requirement
because of any extraneous factors like caste, creed, religion, political
belief or ideology. Every State is supposed to know these fundamental
requirements and this needs no retaliation (sic repetition). We can only
say this with regard to the criticism levelled against the State of
Gujarat. Some legislative enactments like the Terrorist and Disruptive
Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (in short ""the TADA Act"") have taken
note of the reluctance shown by witnesses to depose against people
with muscle power, money power or political power which has become
the order of the day. If ultimately truth is to be arrived at, the eyes and
ears of justice have to be protected so that the interests of justice do
not get incapacitated in the sense of making the proceedings before the
courts mere mock trials as are usually seen in movies.
42. Likewise, in Sakshi v. Union of India [Sakshi v. Union of India,
MANU/SC/0523/2004 : (2004) 5 SCC 518: 2004 SCC (Cri.) 1645], the menace
of witnesses turning hostile was again described in the following words: (SCC
pp. 544-45, para 32)
32. The mere sight of the Accused may induce an element of extreme
fear in the mind of the victim or the witnesses or can put them in a
state of shock. In such a situation he or she may not be able to give
full details of the incident which may result in miscarriage of justice.
Therefore, a screen or some such arrangement can be made where the
victim or witnesses do not have to undergo the trauma of seeing the
body or the face of the Accused. Often the questions put in crossexamination
are purposely designed to embarrass or confuse the
victims of rape and child abuse. The object is that out of the feeling of
shame or embarrassment, the victim may not speak out or give details
of certain acts committed by the Accused. It will, therefore, be better if
the questions to be put by the Accused in cross-examination are given
in writing to the presiding officer of the court, who may put the same
to the victim or witnesses in a language which is not embarrassing.
There can hardly be any objection to the other suggestion given by the
Petitioner that whenever a child or victim of rape is required to give
testimony, sufficient breaks should be given as and when required. The
provisions of Sub-section (2) of Section 327 Code of Criminal
Procedure should also apply in inquiry or trial of offences Under
Sections 354 and 377 Indian Penal Code.
43. In State v. Sanjeev Nanda [State v. Sanjeev Nanda, MANU/SC/0621/2012 :
(2012) 8 SCC 450: (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 487: (2012) 3 SCC (Civ) 899], the
Court felt constrained in reiterating the growing disturbing trend: (SCC pp.
486-87, paras 99-101)
99. Witness turning hostile is a major disturbing factor faced by the
criminal courts in India. Reasons are many for the witnesses turning
hostile, but of late, we see, especially in high profile cases, there is a
regularity in the witnesses turning hostile, either due to monetary
consideration or by other tempting offers which undermine the entire
criminal justice system and people carry the impression that the mighty
and powerful can always get away from the clutches of law, thereby
eroding people's faith in the system.
100. This Court in State of U.P. v. Ramesh Prasad Misra [State of U.P.
v. Ramesh Prasad Misra, MANU/SC/0706/1996 : (1996) 10 SCC 360:
1996 SCC (Cri.) 1278] held that it is equally settled law that the
evidence of a hostile witness could not be totally rejected, if spoken in
favour of the prosecution or the Accused, but it can be subjected to
closest scrutiny and that portion of the evidence which is consistent
with the case of the prosecution or defence may be accepted. In K.
Anbazhagan v. Supt. of Police [K. Anbazhagan v. Supt. of Police,
MANU/SC/0930/2003 : (2004) 3 SCC 767: 2004 SCC (Cri.) 882], this
Court held that if a court finds that in the process the credit of the
witness has not been completely shaken, he may after reading and
considering the evidence of the witness as a whole, with due caution,
accept, in the light of the evidence on the record that part of his
testimony which it finds to be creditworthy and act upon it. This is
exactly what was done in the instant case by both the trial court and
the High Court [Sanjeev Nanda v. State, MANU/DE/1019/2009 : (2009)
160 DLT 775] and they found the Accused guilty.
101. We cannot, however, close our eyes to the disturbing fact in the
instant case where even the injured witness, who was present on the
spot, turned hostile. This Court in Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of Delhi)
[Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of Delhi), MANU/SC/0268/2010 : (2010) 6
SCC 1: (2010) 2 SCC (Cri.) 1385] and in Zahira Habibullah Sheikh (5)
v. State of Gujarat [Zahira Habibullah Sheikh (5) v. State of Gujarat,
MANU/SC/1344/2006 : (2006) 3 SCC 374: (2006) 2 SCC (Cri.) 8] had
highlighted the glaring defects in the system like non-recording of the
statements correctly by the police and the retraction of the statements
by the prosecution witness due to intimidation, inducement and other
methods of manipulation. Courts, however, cannot shut their eyes to
the reality. If a witness becomes hostile to subvert the judicial process,
the court shall not stand as a mute spectator and every effort should be
made to bring home the truth. Criminal judicial system cannot be
overturned by those gullible witnesses who act under pressure,
inducement or intimidation. Further, Section 193 Indian Penal Code
imposes punishment for giving false evidence but is seldom invoked.
44. On the analysis of various cases, the following reasons can be discerned
which make witnesses retracting their statements before the court and turning
hostile:
(i) Threat/Intimidation.
(ii) Inducement by various means.
(iii) Use of muscle and money power by the Accused.
(iv) Use of stock witnesses.
(v) Protracted trials.
(vi) Hassles faced by the witnesses during investigation and trial.
(vii) Non-existence of any clear-cut legislation to check hostility of
witness.
45. Threat and intimidation has been one of the major causes for the hostility
of witnesses. Bentham said: ""witnesses are the eyes and ears of justice"". When
the witnesses are not able to depose correctly in the court of law, it results in
low rate of conviction and many times even hardened criminals escape the
conviction. It shakes public confidence in the criminal justice delivery system.
It is for this reason there has been a lot of discussion on witness protection and
from various quarters demand is made for the State to play a definite role in
coming out with witness protection programme, at least in sensitive cases
involving those in power, who have political patronage and could wield muscle
and money power, to avert trial getting tainted and derailed and truth becoming
a casualty. A stern and emphatic message to this effect was given in Zahira
Habibullah case [Zahira Habibullah Sheikh (5) v. State of Gujarat,
MANU/SC/1344/2006 : (2006) 3 SCC 374: (2006) 2 SCC (Cri.) 8] as well.
46. Justifying the measures to be taken for witness protection to enable the
witnesses to depose truthfully and without fear, Justice Malimath Committee
Report on Reforms of Criminal Justice System, 2003 has remarked as under:
11.3. Another major problem is about safety of witnesses and their
family members who face danger at different stages. They are often
threatened and the seriousness of the threat depends upon the type of
the case and the background of the Accused and his family. Many times
crucial witnesses are threatened or injured prior to their testifying in
the court. If the witness is still not amenable he may even be
murdered. In such situations the witness will not come forward to give
evidence unless he is assured of protection or is guaranteed anonymity
of some form of physical disguise. ... Time has come for a
comprehensive law being enacted for protection of the witness and
members of his family.
47. Almost to similar effect are the observations of the Law Commission of
India in its 198th Report [Report on ""witness identity protection and witness
protection programmes"".], as can be seen from the following discussion
therein:
The reason is not far to seek. In the case of victims of terrorism and
sexual offences against women and juveniles, we are dealing with a
Section of society consisting of very vulnerable people, be they victims
or witnesses. The victims and witnesses are under fear of or danger to
their lives or lives of their relations or to their property. It is obvious
that in the case of serious offences under the Indian Penal Code, 1860
and other special enactments, some of which we have referred to
above, there are bound to be absolutely similar situations for victims
and witnesses. While in the case of certain offences under special
statutes such fear or danger to victims and witnesses may be more
common and pronounced, in the case of victims and witnesses involved
or concerned with some serious offences, fear may be no less
important. Obviously, if the trial in the case of special offences is to be
fair both to the Accused as well as to the victims/witnesses, then there
is no reason as to why it should not be equally fair in the case of other
general offences of serious nature falling under the Indian Penal Code,
1860. It is the fear or danger or rather the likelihood thereof that is
common to both cases. That is why several general statutes in other
countries provide for victim and witness protection.
8 . All this has created problems of low convictions in India. This has serious
repercussions on the criminal justice system itself. Criminal justice is closely associated
with human rights. Whereas, on the one hand, it is to be ensured that no innocent
person is convicted and thereby deprived of his liberty, it is of equal importance to
ensure, on the other hand, that victims of crime get justice by punishing the offender.
In this whole process, protection of witnesses assumes significance to enable them to
depose fearlessly and truthfully. That would also ensure fair trial as well, which is
another concomitant of the Rule of law.
9. Since this case relates to the issue of protection of witnesses, we are eschewing any
further discussion on other miseries faced by the witnesses, though we emphasise the
need for addressing other problems as well, at appropriate level, if the criminal justice
system in this country is to succeed. Adverting to the importance of witness protection,
we may mention that it has been highlighted and emphasised by the courts in India,
including this Court, time and again. Issues of protection of identity of witnesses and
witness protection programme have been raised in number of judgments like NHRC v.
State of Gujarat 2003 (9) SCALE 329, People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) v.
Union of India MANU/SC/1036/2003 : 2003 (10) SCALE 967,Z ahira v. State of
Gujarat MANU/SC/0322/2004 : (2004) 4 SCC 158,S akshi v. Union of India
MANU/SC/0523/2004 : (2004) 5 SCC 518 andZ ahira Habibulla Sheikh v. Gujarat
1 0 . I n People's Union for Civil Liberties, wherein constitutionality some of the
provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA), 2002, were challenged, the Court
carefully analyzed Section 30 of the Act, which had mentioned about the protection of
witnesses. This provision provides for the proceedings to be held in camera in order to
keep the identity of witness confidential. The Court felt the reality that very often
witnesses do not come forward to testify before court in serious crimes. Witnesses are
not ready to give evidence mainly because their lives might be in danger. In the court's
view, Section 30 of the Act maintains a balance between the rights of a witness, the
rights of an Accused and the interest of the public. However, secrecy of the witness is
an exception and not a Rule under this section.
11. The protection of a child witness, who may also be a victim, becomes all the more
important. In Sakshi v. Union of India MANU/SC/0523/2004 : (2004) 5 SCC 518, the
Court stressed that there is a dire need to come up with a legislation for the protection
of witnesses. The Court also had issued certain guidelines on the procedure of taking of
evidence from a child witness. The Court also pointed out the need for special
protection to a victim of sexual abuse at the time of recording her statement in court.
The Petitioner in that case had given certain suggestions for effectively dealing with the
special provisions for testimony in child sexual abuse cases, which were as follows:
a) The judges shall allow the use of a videotaped interview of the testimony of
the child in the presence of a child-support person.
b) A child could be permitted to testify through closed circuit television or from
behind a screen to acquire an honest and frank account of the acts complained
of without any fear.
c) Only the judge should be allowed to cross-examine a minor on the basis of
the questions given by the defence in writing after the examination of the
minor.
d) During the testimony of the child, sufficient interval should be provided as
and when she requires it.
12. In some other judgments, this Court gave some more guidelines, in the following
manner:
a) Sections 354 and 377 of the Indian Penal Code should be tried and
inquired on the same principles mentioned Under Sub-section (2) of
Section 327 Code of Criminal Procedure.
b) While holding the trial of rape or child sex abuse, some sort of arrangements
like a screen or something like it may be used so as to make sure that victim or
witnesses (who are equally vulnerable and need protection like the victim) do
not confront the Accused;
c) Questions raised during the cross-examination by the counsel of the Accused
that are directly related to and be reminiscent to the victim or the witnesses of
the incident should be written down and given to the presiding officer of the
court in advance. The presiding officer must put forth those questions to the
victim or witness in simple and clear language and as far as possible without
making her uncomfortable;
13. It hardly needs to be emphasised that failure to hear material witness is denial of
fair trial. The practice, however, to give protection to the witnesses is based on ad
hocism, i.e., on case to case basis. The Courts have also, in the process, adopted
different means to ensure witness protection, which can be stated in brief detail:
(a) Publication of evidence of the witness only during the course of trial and not
after [Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar and Ors. v. State of Maharashtra and
Anr.; [MANU/SC/0044/1966 : 1966 (3) SCR 744].
(b) Re-trial allowed due to apprehension and threat to the life of witness
[Sunil Kumar Pal v. Phota Sheikh and Ors.; MANU/SC/0129/1984 : AIR
1984 SC 1591]
(c) Necessity of anonymity for victims in cases of rape [Delhi Domestic
Working Women's Forum v. Union of India; MANU/SC/0519/1995 : (1995)
1 SCC 14)]
(d) Discouraging the practice of obtaining adjournments in cases when witness
is present and Accused is absent. [State of U.P. v. Shambhu Nath Singh;
MANU/SC/0221/2001 : (2001) 4 SCC 667]
(e) Making threatening of witnesses as a ground for cancellation of bail [Ram
Govind Upadhyay v. Sudarshan Singh; MANU/SC/0203/2002 : II (2002)
SLT 587]
( f ) Cross-examination by video conferencing -- This is one of the
innovative methods devised, which is specifically helpful to the victims of
sexual crimes, particularly, child witnesses who are victims of crime as well.
1 4 . In the instant case itself the Petitioners have approached this Court with the
allegations that in the trials that are going on against Asaram, who is charged with the
offence of committing rapes in numerous cases, the witnesses have been threatened
with serious consequences in case they depose against Asaram. It is alleged that as
many as 10 witnesses have already been attacked and three witnesses have been killed.
15. There are four Petitioners in this petition. These Petitioners include a witness, father
of a murdered witness, father of the child rape victim and a journalist who escaped a
murder attempt by goons of godman Asaram and his son Naryana Sai and still faces
death threats by a jailed sharpshooter of Asaram and Narayan Sai. It is stated that
Petitioner No. 1 Mahender Chawla miraculously survived a murder attempt on his life for
daring to testify against so called godman, Asaram Bapu and his son Narayan Sai in
horrifying cases of rape of a child and two sisters. Petitioner No. 1 also witnessed
Narayan Sai doing Tantrik Practice on a dead body of a child in an Asaram in Madhya
Pradesh, in which till date there has not been any investigation due to the influence of
Asaram. Petitioner No. 2 Naresh Gupta is the father of a murdered witness, named,
Akhil Gupta. Akhil was killed for daring to be a witness against Asaram. Petitioner No. 3
Karamvir Singh is the father of a child, who was raped by Asaram. Petitioner No. 3's son
Somvir was threatened by 2 attackers despite having State police security. The attackers
were apprehended and released on bail. Shockingly the same attacker, named Narayan
Pandey, later killed a rape-case prosecution witness Kripal Singh. The child rape
victim's family has been attacked, threatened and lives in constant fear. It is also
alleged that despite being threatened, the Uttar Pradesh Police shockingly withdrew half
of their security. Petitioner No. 4, Narendra Yadav is a journalist who survived a murder
attempt on his life because he dared to write articles to the dislike of Asaram Bapu and
Narayan Sai. He now lives in constant fear of being killed as the Uttar Pradesh Police
has given him a solitary security guard for just eight hours a day, leaving him to fend
for himself through the remaining 16 hours. It is also averred that the sharp shooter of
Asaram, Narayan Pandey, who is in jail for murdering a witness Kripal Singh, writes
threatening letters to him from inside the jail.
16. The Petitioners have prayed for a court monitored SIT or a CBI probe. It is stated
by the Petitioners that the prevailing feeling of fear amongst witnesses in the country
seriously impairs the right of the people of this country to live in a free society
governed by Rule of law. The right to testify in courts in a free and fair manner without
any pressure and threat whatsoever is under serious attack today. If one is unable to
testify in courts due to threats or other pressures, then it is a clear violation of Article
21 of the Constitution. The right to life guaranteed to the people of this country also
includes in its fold the right to live in a society, which is free from crime and fear and
right of witnesses to testify in courts without fear or pressure.
17. The Petitioners had initially impleaded Union of India as Respondent No. 1 and
States of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh as
Respondent Nos. 2 to 6.
18. Appreciating the importance and seriousness of the matter, this Court issued show
cause notices in the petition on November 18, 2016. After the service of the notice
when the matter came up for hearing on March 24, 2017, this Court also directed the
States of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to ensure full and proper protection to the
Petitioners by providing adequate security.
19. When the matter was again listed on August 28, 2017, Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned
Attorney General appeared on behalf of the Union of India, along with Ms. Pinky Anand,
Additional Solicitor General. It was pointed out that since this Court was primarily
dealing with the issue pertaining to witness protection programme, it would be
appropriate that other States are also impleaded inasmuch as the issue had PAN India
significant and witness protection programme should be available in all the States. The
Petitioners were, accordingly, directed to implead other States as well and they be
served with the notice of this petition. This is how the coverage of the petition has been
extended to the entire country, encompassing all the States and Union Territories.
2 0 . The petition was amended and all the States and Union Territories have been
served and are represented through their respective counsel. When the matter was
thereafter taken up for hearing on November 17, 2017 all the Respondents were called
upon to file their responses indicating as to what steps could be taken to have the
witness protection programme in place.
2 1 . Mr. Venugopal, learned Attorney General for India was also requested to give
suggestions in the form of a draft scheme. It is heartening to note that Union of India
did not take this petition as adversarial and understood the necessity of having such a
scheme in the larger public interest. With this sensitivity in mind, Ministry of Home
Affairs have prepared a draft witness protection scheme, 2018 and placed the same on
record of this case. This was noted in the orders dated April 13, 2018 and the State
Governments as well as Union Territories, who had already been supplied with the copy
of the draft scheme by the Ministry itself, were asked to furnish their comments by May
31, 2018 to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Union Government was impressed upon to
finalise the scheme after receiving the comments/suggestions from the various
Governments. Order dated April 13, 2018, incorporating the aforesaid aspects, is
reproduced below:
We are informed that the Ministry of Home Affairs has prepared a draft Witness
Protection Scheme 2018. A copy of the said draft scheme is handed over to us
in the court today. Vide letter dated 22nd March, 2018, a copy of the said
scheme is also provided to all the State Governments and the Union Territories
Administration requesting them to furnish their comments by 9th April, 2018.
Thereafter, again by reminder dated 11th April, 2018 all the State Governments
and Union Territories were asked to furnish their comments by 31st May, 2018.
We expect all the State Governments as well as the Union Territories to furnish
their comments by the aforesaid stipulated date of 31st May, 2018 to the
Ministry of Home Affairs. After receiving the comments/suggestions the draft
Witness Protection Scheme 2018 shall be finalized by the Government, Ministry
of Home Affairs before the next date.
List the matter in the second week of August, 2018.
Learned amicus curiae is also at liberty to furnish his suggestions.
22. When the matter was taken up on November 19, 2018, the learned Attorney General
informed that after taking the inputs from various States and Union Territories, Central
Government had finalized the scheme and filed it in this Court on November 06, 2018
supported by its affidavit. He was also candid in his submission that this Court can pass
appropriate orders directing all the States to adopt that scheme and provide a witness
protection in accordance therewith till the time appropriate legislation in this behalf is
passed.
23. We may place on record that as per the affidavit of the Central Government, the
Witness Protection Scheme, 2018 is based on the inputs received from 18 States/Union
Territories, 5 States Legal Services Authorities and open sources including civil society,
three High Courts as well as from Police personnel. It is also stated that the scheme has
been finalised in consultation with National Legal Services Authority (NALSA). It is
mentioned that the aim and objective of the scheme is to ensure that the investigation,
prosecution and trial of criminal offences is not prejudiced because witnesses are
intimidated or frightened to give evidence without protection from violent or other
criminal recrimination. It aims to promote law enforcement by facilitating the protection
of persons who are involved directly or indirectly in providing assistance to criminal law
enforcement agencies and overall administration of justice.
24. The affidavit further emphasises that the witnesses need to be given the confidence
to come forward to assist law enforcement and judicial authorities with full assurance of
safety and the present Scheme is aimed to identify the series of measures that may be
adopted to safeguard witnesses and their family members from intimidate and threats
against their lives, reputation and property.
2 5 . At this stage, we reproduce Witness Protection Scheme, 2018 as filed, in its
entirety:
Witness Protection Scheme, 2018
PREFACE
Aims & Objective:
The ability of a witness to give testimony in a judicial setting or to
cooperate with law enforcement and investigations without fear of
intimidation or reprisal is essential in maintaining the Rule of law. The
objective of this Scheme is to ensure that the investigation, prosecution
and trial of criminal offences is not prejudiced because witnesses are
intimidated or frightened to give evidence without protection from
violent or other criminal recrimination. It aims to promote law
enforcement by facilitating the protection of persons who are involved
directly or indirectly in providing assistance to criminal law
enforcement agencies and overall administration of Justice. Witnesses
need to be given the confidence to come forward to assist law
enforcement and Judicial Authorities with full assurance of safety. It is
aimed to identify series of measures that may be adopted to safeguard
witnesses and their family members from intimidation and threats
against their lives, reputation and property.
Need and justification for the scheme:
Jeremy Bentham has said that ""Witnesses are the eyes and ears of
justice."" In cases involving influential people, witnesses turn hostile
because of threat to life and property. Witnesses find that there is no
legal obligation by the state for extending any security.
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India also held in State of Gujarat v. Anirudh
Singh MANU/SC/0749/1997 : (1997) 6 SCC 514 that: ""It is the salutary
duty of every witness who has the knowledge of the commission of the
crime, to assist the State in giving evidence.""
Malimath Committee on Reforms of Criminal Justice System, 2003 said in its report that
""By giving evidence relating to the commission of an offence, he performs a sacred duty
of assisting the court to discover the truth"". Zahira Habibulla H. Sheikh and Anr. v.
State of Gujarat MANU/SC/0322/2004 : 2004 (4) SCC 158 SC while defining Fair Trial
said ""If the witnesses get threatened or are forced to give false evidence that also would
not result in a fair trial"".
First ever reference to Witness Protection in India came in 14th Report of the Law
Commission of India in 1958. Further reference on the subject are found in 154th and
178th report of the Law Commission in India. 198th Report of the Law Commission of
India titled as ""Witness Identity Protection and Witness Protection Programmes, 2006"" is
dedicated to the subject.
Hon'ble Supreme Court observed in Zahira case supra, ""country can afford to expose its
morally correct citizens to the peril of being harassed by anti-social elements like
rapists and murderers"". The 4th National Police Commission Report, 1980 noted
'prosecution witnesses are turning hostile because of pressure of Accused and there is
need of Regulation to check manipulation of witnesses.""
Legislature has introduced Section 195A Indian Penal Code in 2006 making Criminal
Intimidation of Witnesses a criminal offence punishable with seven years of
imprisonment. Likewise, in statues namely Juvenile Justice (Acre and Protection of
Children) Act, 2015, Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2011, Protection of Children from
Sexual Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 also provides for
safeguarding witnesses again the threats. However no formal structured programme has
been introduced as on date for addressing the issue of witness protection in a holistic
manner.
In recent year's extremism, terrorism and organized crimes have grown and are
becoming stronger and more diverse. In the investigation becoming and prosecution of
such crimes, it is essential that witnesses, have trust in criminal justice system.
Witnesses need to have the confidence to come forward to assist law enforcement and
prosecuting agencies. They need to be assured that they will receive support and
protection from intimidation and the harm that criminal groups might seek to inflict
upon them in order to discourage them from co-operating with the law enforcement
agencies and deposing before the court of law. Hence, it is high time that a scheme is
put in place for addressing the issues of witness protection uniformly in the country.
Scope of the Scheme:
Witness Protection may be as simple as providing a police escort to the witness
up to the Courtroom or using modern communication technology (such as audio
video means) for recording of testimony. In other more complex cases,
involving organised criminal group, extraordinary measures are required to
ensure the witness's safety viz. anonymity, offering temporary residence in a
safe house, giving a new identity, and relocation of the witness at an
undisclosed place. However, Witness protection needs of a witness may have to
be viewed on case to case basis depending upon their vulnerability and threat
perception.

As long as identity of any witness is protected under an order of the Competent
Authority, the Witness Protection Cell shall provide details of persons who can be
contacted by the witness in case of emergency.

2 6 . As is clear from its reading, the essential features of the Witness Protection
Scheme, 2018 include identifying categories of threat perceptions, preparation of a
""Threat Analysis Report"" by the Head of the Police, types of protection measures like
ensuring that the witness and Accused do not come face to face during investigation
etc. protection of identity, change of identity, relocation of witness, witnesses to be
apprised of the scheme, confidentiality and preservation of records, recovery of
expenses etc.
27. Since it is beneficial and benevolent scheme which is aimed at strengthening the
criminal justice system in this country, which shall in turn ensure not only access to
justice but also advance the cause the justice itself, all the States and Union Territories
also accepted that suitable directions can be passed by the court to enforce the said
Scheme as a mandate of the court till the enactment of a statute by the Legislatures.
28. It is clear from the aforesaid events that the Scheme is the outcome of the efforts
put in by the Central Government with due assistance not only from the State
Governments as well as Union Territories but other stakeholders including Police
personnel, NALSA and State Legal Services Authorities, High Courts and even civil
society. There is no reason not to accede to the aforesaid submission of the learned
Attorney General and other Respondents.
29. As pointed out above, in Sakshi's case, the Court had insisted about the need to
come up with a legislation for the protection of witnesses. It had even requested the
Law Commission to examine certain aspects, which resulted to 172nd review of rape
laws by the Law Commission. However, the Court specifically rejected the suggestion of
the Law Commission regarding examination of vulnerable witnesses in the absence of
Accused. Having regard to the provisions of Section 273 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, which is based on the tenets of principle of natural justice, that the witness
must be examined in the presence of the Accused, such a principle cannot be sacrificed
in trials and in inquiries regarding sexual offences. In such a scenario examination of
these witnesses through video conferencing provides the solution which balances the
interest of the Accused as well as vulnerable witnesses.
30. Part II(7)(L) of the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018 provides for usage of specially
designed court room having special arrangements like live links, one way mirrors, and
screens apart from separate passages for witnesses and Accused with the option to
modify the image of the face of the witness and to modify the audio feed of the
witness's voice, so that he/she is not identified.
3 1 . In consonance with the same, the Delhi Judiciary has already established four
Vulnerable Witness Deposition Complexes in the National Capital Territory, the latest
one being at the Dwarka District Court, which was established in February, 2017. This
complex provides facilities like separate witness room, separate Accused room, play
area for the child witnesses, pantry, separate toilet and an exclusive & comfortable
waiting area and is equipped with all facilities of audio-visual exchange for a free
interface between the presiding Judge, the witness and the Accused without witness
facing the Accused. The complex has a separate entry for vulnerable witnesses, so that
they do not come in direct contact with Accused at any point of time. There are
provisions for support persons, pre-trial court visit and facilities for pick and drop of the
witnesses from their residence. In this way, all possible efforts have been made for
providing comfortable environment to vulnerable witnesses at this complex in order to
enable them to give their best evidence in criminal proceedings.
32. One of the main reasons behind establishing these Vulnerable Witness Deposition
Complexes was that a large percentage of acquittals in criminal cases is due to
witnesses turning hostile and giving false testimonies, mostly due to lack of protection
for them and their families, especially in case of women and children.
3 3 . In fact, the Supreme Court too, in The State of Maharashtra v. Bandu @
Daulat (Order dt. 24.20.2017 in Crl. Appeal No. 1820/2017) has directed as
follows:
10. ... there should be special centres for examination of vulnerable witnesses
in criminal cases in the interest of conducive environment in Court so as to
encourage a vulnerable victim to make a statement. Such centres ought to be
set up with all necessary safeguards. Our attention has been drawn to
guidelines issued by the Delhi High Court for recording evidence of vulnerable
witnesses in criminal matters and also the fact that four special centres have
been set up at Delhi for the purpose.
*****
12. The directions of Delhi High Court and setting up of special centres for
vulnerable witnesses as noted above are consistent with the decision of this
Court and supplement the same. We are of the view that all High Courts can
adopt such guidelines if the same have not yet been adopted with such
modifications as may be deemed necessary. Setting up of one center for
vulnerable witnesses may be perhaps required almost in every district in the
country. All the High Courts may take appropriate steps in this direction in due
course in phases. At least two such centres in the jurisdiction of each High
Court may be set up within three months from today. Thereafter, more such
centres may be set up as per decision of the High Courts.
34. One thing which emerges from the aforesaid discussion is that there is a paramount
need to have witness protection regime, in a statutory form, which all the stakeholders
and all the players in the criminal justice system concede. At the same time no such
legislation has been brought about. These are the considerations which had influenced
this Court to have a holistic regime of witness protection which should be considered as
law Under Article 141 of the Constitution till a suitable law is framed.
35. We, accordingly, direct that:
(i) This Court has given its imprimatur to the Scheme prepared by Respondent
No. 1 which is approved hereby. It comes into effect forthwith.
(ii) The Union of India as well as States and Union Territories shall enforce the
Witness Protection Scheme, 2018 in letter and spirit.
(iii) It shall be the 'law' Under Article 141/142 of the Constitution, till the
enactment of suitable Parliamentary and/or State Legislations on the subject.
(iv) In line with the aforesaid provisions contained in the Scheme, in all the
district courts in India, vulnerable witness deposition complexes shall be set up
by the States and Union Territories. This should be achieved within a period of
one year, i.e., by the end of the year 2019. The Central Government should also
support this endeavour of the States/Union Territories by helping them
financially and otherwise.

Facts:
Instant writ petition filed by Petitioners under Article 32 of Constitution of
India raised important issues touching upon efficacy of criminal justice
system in this country. In an adversarial system, which was prevalent by
India, court was supposed to decide cases on basis of evidence produced
before it. This evidence could be in form of documents. It could be oral
evidence as well, i.e., deposition of witnesses. Witnesses, thus, play a vital
role in facilitating court to arrive at correct findings on disputed questions of
facts and to find out where truth lies. They were, therefore, backbone in
decision making process. Whenever, in a dispute, two sides come out with
conflicting version, witnesses become important tool to arrive at right
conclusions, thereby advancing justice in a matter. This principle applied with
more vigor and strength in criminal cases inasmuch as most of such cases
were decided on basis of testimonies of witnesses, particularly, eyewitnesses,
who may had seen actual occurrence/crime. It hardly needs to be
emphasised that one of main reasons for witnesses to turn hostile was that
they were not accorded appropriate protection by State. It was a harsh
reality, particularly, in those cases where Accused persons/criminals were
tried for heinous offences, or where Accused persons were influential persons
or in a dominating position that y make attempts to terrorize or intimidate
witnesses because of which se witnesses eir avoid coming to courts or refrain
from deposing truthfully. In instant case itself, Petitioners had approached
this Court with allegations that in trials that were going on against Asaram,
who was charged with offence of committing rapes in numerous cases,
witnesses had been frightened with serious consequences in case y depose
against Asaram. It was alleged that as many as 10 witnesses had already
been attacked and three witnesses had been killed. Petitioners had prayed for
a court monitored SIT or a CBI probe.
Held, while disposing of the petition
1. Petitioners had initially impleaded Union of India as Respondent No. 1 and
States of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh as
Respondent Nos. 2 to 6. [17]
2. Appreciating importance and seriousness of matter, this Court issued show
cause notices in petition on November 18, 2016. After service of notice, when
matter came up for hearing on March 24, 2017, this Court also directed States
of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to ensure full and proper protection to
Petitioners by providing adequate security. [18]
3. Ministry of Home Affairs had prepared a draft Witness Protection Scheme
2018. A copy of said draft scheme was handed over to court. [21]
4. When matter was taken up on November 19, 2018, learned Attorney
General informed that after taking inputs from various States and Union
Territories, Central Government had finalized Witness Protection Scheme
2018 and filed it in this Court on November 06, 2018 supported by its
affidavit. [22]
5. As per affidavit of Central Government, Witness Protection Scheme, 2018
was based on inputs received from 18 States/Union Territories, 5 States Legal
Services Authorities and open sources including civil society, three High
Courts as well as from Police personnel. It was also stated that scheme had
been finalised in consultation with National Legal Services Authority (NALSA).
It was mentioned that , aim and objective of scheme was to ensure that
investigation, prosecution and trial of criminal offences was not prejudiced
because witnesses were intimidated or frightened to give evidence without
protection from violent or or criminal recrimination. It aims to promote law
enforcement by facilitating protection of persons who were involved directly
or indirectly in providing assistance to criminal law enforcement agencies and
overall administration of justice. [23]
6. Affidavit further emphasised that, witnesses need to be given confidence to
come forward to assist law enforcement and judicial authorities with full
assurance of safety and present Scheme was aimed to identify series of
measures that may be adopted to safeguard witnesses and their family
members from intimidate and threats against their lives, reputation and
property. [24]
7. Essential features of Witness Protection Scheme, 2018 included identifying
categories of threat perceptions, preparation of a ""Threat Analysis Report"" by
Head of Police, types of protection measures like ensuring that witness and
Accused do not come face to face during investigation etc. protection of
identity, change of identity, relocation of witness, witnesses to be apprised of
scheme, confidentiality and preservation of records, recovery of expenses etc.
[26]
8. Since it was beneficial and benevolent scheme which was aimed at
strengthening criminal justice system in this country, which shall in turn
ensure not only access to justice but also advance cause justice itself, all
States and Union Territories also accepted that suitable directions could be
passed by court to enforce said Scheme as a mandate of court till enactment

or stakeholders including Police personnel, NALSA and State Legal Services
Authorities, High Courts and even civil society. re was no reason not to accede
to aforesaid submission of learned Attorney General and or Respondents. [28]

15. Writ petition disposed off. [36]",,,,
"N.V. Ramana, J.
1 . These appeals by special leave arise out of the common impugned judgment dated
29.05.2009, passed by the High Court of Allahabad in Criminal Appeal Nos. 1419, 1430,
1518 and 898 of 2004, whereby the High Court has reversed the judgment of conviction
passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Kanpur in Sessions Trial No. 164/2002 dated
22.01.2004 Under Sections 302 read with 149, 307 read with 149, 148 Indian Penal
Code and Section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932. Whereas the High Court in
Government Appeal No. 5270 of 2005 preferred by the Appellant-State, has dismissed
the appeal against the acquittal of Accused No. 1-Respondent (Wasif Haider) for
offences Under Sections 25 and 27 of Arms Act, 1959 and Sections 4 and 15 of
Explosive Substances Act, 1908, while affirming the judgment dated 3.8.2005 passed by
the Additional Sessions judge, Kanpur acquitting the Accused No. 1-Respondent (Wasif
Haider) in Sessions Trial No. 143 and 144 of 2002.
2 . Brief facts as unfolded from the prosecution story are that, while the complainant
(P.W. 2-S.O., P.S. Moolganj, Kanpur) along with other police personnel was on duty at
the parade crossing, he came to know that a crowd of around 200-300 rioters were
causing rampage and destruction at the Chaubey Gola Temple. Immediately, the
complainant accompanied by the police force and A.D.M. (Finance and Revenue)-Sri
Chandra Prakash Pathak (hereinafter referred as ""the deceased""), and half a Section
of Provincial Armed Constabulary [""PAC""] proceeded towards scene of occurrence.
Admittedly, when the deceased along with police personnel were at a distance of around
100-150 paces from Sunehri Mosque on the Nai Sarak, rioters started firing upon them
resultantly injuring the deceased and his orderly, Ram Chandra. In order to control the
law and order situation, the police were compelled to fire in their defense. When the
police party reached the mosque, the rioters had already fled away. Subsequently, when
the police party reached Chaubey Gola Temple where rioters had already looted some
houses and had also committed arson. In the meanwhile, the police also received the
information that the deceased had succumbed to the gunshot injuries in the hospital.
Finally, the F.I.R., Case Crime No. 7 of 2001 came to be registered at 8.05 P.M. on
16.03.2001 against 200-300 unknown rioters.
3. On the same night, after conducting the inquest proceedings, the dead body was sent
for post mortem examination and the investigation commenced. The investigation
officer after recording the statement of witnesses, inspected the place of occurrence and
prepared Site Plan ext. Ka-6. A bullet which was recovered from the ashes of deceased
was sent for Forensic examination.
4 . On 02.08.2001 Accused No. 2-Respondent (Mumtaz alias Maulana) was brought to
Kanpur by the Delhi police. On 04.08.2001, Accused No. 1-Respondent (Wasif Haider)
was arrested. Accused No. 3-Respondent (Hazi Atiq) and Accused No. 4-Respondent
(Safat Rasool) were arrested on 17.09.2001 and 18.09.2001 respectively and thereafter
the Test Identification Parade (hereinafter referred to as ""TIP"") was held on 27.09.2001
at District Jail, Kanpur. Subsequent to the completion of investigation, the charge-sheet
was submitted.
5. The Accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. It is pertinent to note that in
the statements made by the Accused Under Section 313 of Code of Criminal Procedure.
They claimed that there existed an inordinate delay in conducting the TIP, as this time
period was used by the prosecution witnesses to see them at their homes or places of
work to mark them carefully for the subsequent identification. They stressed on the fact
that they were not kept concealed in a veil (baparda). The Accused-Respondents have
further stated that, prior to the TIP, the police had taken their photographs and had
shown it to the other witnesses. This creates a considerable doubt about the
genuineness of the TIP. Further, the Accused-Respondents have alleged that, they were
wrongfully roped in the case when the police failed to trace the real culprits. The
Accused Respondents have also put forth that, although they had clear antecedents, but
they were implicated in the crime falsely.
6 . By order dated 22.01.2004, the trial court, while relying upon the prosecution
version, rejected the defence story and convicted the Accused persons as under,
7 . Aggrieved by the abovementioned order of conviction and sentence, the Accused-
Respondents appealed before the High Court. The High Court on analysis of evidence
found that, not only there exists various contradictions in the testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses but there exists lack of corroboration of the same. While passing
the order of acquittal the High Court observed that the case of prosecution was ridden
with flaws in investigation, most importantly the identification of the Accused was
highly suspicious and the TIP was held to be ""too good to be believed"". Accordingly, the
High Court through the impugned judgment acquitted the Accused-Respondents and set
aside the aforesaid order of conviction as the prosecution failed to prove its case
beyond reasonable doubt.
8 . Aggrieved by the impugned order passed by the High Court acquitting all the
Accused, the State of Uttar Pradesh has preferred these appeals.
9 . The learned Counsel, Mr. Dinesh Kumar Goswami, on behalf of the Appellant-State
while supporting the prosecution's case, submitted that pursuant to the arrest of the
Accused-Respondents their identification was properly done after taking due precautions
and following the procedure. Moreover, the prosecution witnesses had clearly identified
the Accused persons in the identification parade and in the court as well. On the issue
of delay caused in conducting the TIP, the counsel also vehemently submitted that,
there was no inordinate delay in conducting the TIP as canvassed by the counsels for
the Accused-Respondents. The High Court has committed a grave error by not placing
reliance on the TIP as there is nothing on record to vitiate the results of the same.
Lastly, the learned Counsel submitted that since there existed sufficient evidence to
prove the culpability of the Accused-Respondents, the Sessions Judge had correctly
passed the order of conviction against them and therefore prayed for setting aside the
impugned order.
10. On the other hand, the learned Counsel, Ms. Kamini Jaiswal, appearing on behalf of
the Accused-Respondents No. 1, 3 and 4, while supporting the order of acquittal
rendered by the High Court, submitted that, the entire prosecution story hinges on the
identification of the Accused-Respondents, the genuineness of which in itself is
questionable. It was further argued that, when admittedly the witnesses were at a great
distance from the place of occurrence, it was not plausible to identify specifically the
Accused-Respondents, that too in the absence of any particular hulia or distinguishing
marks from amongst a crowd of 200-300 rioters. Further, there was inordinate delay in
conducting the TIP which was fatal for the prosecution.
1 1 . Further, the learned Counsel, Mr. Siddhartha Dave, on behalf of Accused-
Respondent No. 2 submitted that accused-Respondent No. 2 has been dragged into the
matter only on account of confessional statement of the co-accused which has not been
corroborated, and no other incriminating evidence is available on record.
12. Heard learned Counsels for the parties. At the outset, we would like to state that in
an appeal against acquittal, the appellate court would interfere only where there exists
perversity of fact and law [See Bannareddy and Ors. v. State of Karnataka and
Ors., MANU/SC/0261/2018 : (2018) 5 SCC 790]. Further, the presumption of innocence
is further reinforced against the acquitted-accused by having a judgment in his favor
[ S e e Rabindra Kumar Pal @ Dara Singh v. Republic of India,
MANU/SC/0062/2011 : (2011) 2 SCC 490 in para. 94].
13. We concur with the aforesaid order of acquittal rendered by the High Court, as the
present case is ridden with multiple investigative laches and flaws which goes to the
root of the matter. We shall be addressing the same in seriatim.
14. Firstly, it is apt to note that out of the seven eye witnesses who participated in the
TIP, five of them identified the Accused without committing any mistake. As observed
by the Accused No. 3-Respondent, Hazi Atiq has big protruding teeth, the Accused No.
4-Respondent Safat Rasool was suffering from polio hence had permanent physical
disability, but surprisingly this fact was never mentioned either in the F.I.R. or in the
witness statements. The specific identification of the four Accused-Respondents, from a
group of 200-300 rioters, with 100% perfection; without a mention of any
distinguishing marks seems highly improbable considering the distance of the witnesses
from the place of occurrence. Moreover, there existed an inordinate delay of 55 days in
conducting the TIP of the Accused No. 1 and 2. Although, the involvement of Accused
No. 3 and 4 was brought to light on 03.08.2001 itself, the prosecution did not take any
effort to arrest or interrogate them for 6 weeks. But no reasonable explanation was
provided for the aforesaid inordinate delay.
15. Furthermore, no documentary evidence has been provided to proof that the identity
of the Accused was kept concealed. On the contrary, D.W. 3, Mohd. Shamim Siddique,
Record Keeper in the Police Office stated that the general diary does not mention that
the Accused No. 2-Respondent Mumtaz alias Maulana was kept baparda. The defence
also pleaded that, the aforesaid inordinate delay was used by the prosecution witnesses
to see the Accused-Respondents at their homes or places of work to mark them
carefully for the subsequent identification. Additionally, Accused No. 1-Respondent
Wasif Haider, in his statement Under Section 313 Code of Criminal Procedure went to
the extent of saying that, prior to the TIP he was shown to the witnesses and his
photographs and videotapes were prepared. In Mulla v. State of U.P.,
MANU/SC/0091/2010 : (2010) 3 SCC 508 para 55, this Court laid down that a TIP has
to be conducted timely, if not, then the delay has to be explained and such delay should
not cause exposure of the accused. However, in the case at hand, not only there was a
delay in conducting the TIP, but no explanation for the same has been forthcoming from
the prosecution. This creates a considerable doubt about the genuineness of the TIP.
16. Secondly, it is surprising that, although the postmortem report describes that there
were only two wounds in the body of the deceased, one being the entry and the other
being the exit wound, allegedly a bullet was still recovered from the ashes of the
deceased. The F.S.L. report shows that this bullet was charred and blistered. This
recovery of bullet from the ashes of the deceased is irreconcilable with the post-mortem
report which allegedly states an exit wound, implying that the bullet had already left the
body. The aforesaid fact raises a suspicion on both the Post-Mortem report and the
F.S.L. report as they are incompatible with each other.
17. Thirdly, the prosecution has failed to establish that the bullet allegedly recovered
from the ashes of the deceased 20 days later was indeed fired from the pistol recovered
from accused-Respondent Wasif Haider. Even, the recovery of pistol is doubtful. While,
the prosecution case reveals that one. 380 bore pistol colt was recovered from the
possession of the accused-Respondent Wasif Haider, on the contrary, the evidence of
P.W. 2-S.O., Rajendra Dhar Dwivedi reveals that one. 320 bore pistol colt was
recovered pursuant to his arrest. Additional contradiction can be seen in the sanction
order wherein two pistols of.380 bore were shown to be recovered from the possession
of the accused-Respondent Wasif Haider.
18. Fourthly, as regards to the place of incident, the prosecution failed to ascertain the
same with precision. While the F.I.R. reveals the place of occurrence to be in front of
Sunehri Masjid, P.W. 2, the complainant later improved over his earlier statement and
stated that, the incident actually took place in Noorani Masjid. On the contrary, the two
site plans show the place of incident to be Noorani Masjid.
19. Fifthly, the prosecution failed to examine Ram Chandra, the orderly of the deceased
who was also injured in the same incident and had suffered a gunshot injury. The
prosecution was also unable to prove the injury report of the above victim. Such a
failure is fatal to the prosecution case as his presence in the place of occurrence is
beyond doubt. It has been placed on record that, despite Ram-Chandra attending the
proceedings of the trial regularly he was not examined by the prosecution.
20. Sixthly, the prosecution has also failed to adduce any independent witness. Even
though it is wrong to disbelieve the evidence adduced from the official witnesses, but
prudence demands that their evidence needs to tested on the altar of strict scrutiny.
Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the evidences adduced by the
prosecution witnesses do not inspire the confidence of this Court.
21. Lastly, it is surprising that although the charges have been framed Under Section
307 of Indian Penal Code, the prosecution has absolutely failed to substantiate the
charges by means of evidence. It is rather unfortunate that the courts below have failed
to take note of the same. The trial court has erred in convicting the Respondents for the
aforesaid offence, without any evidence to prove the same.
22. In the instant appeals before us, the prosecution has failed to link the chain of
circumstances so as to dispel the cloud of doubt about the culpability of the Accused-
Respondents. It is a well settled principle that a suspicion, however grave it may be
cannot take place of proof, i.e., there is a long distance between ""may be"" and ""must
be"", which must be traversed by the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable
doubt [See Narendra Singh v. State of M.P., MANU/SC/0341/2004 : (2004)10 SCC
23. This Court in Kailash Gour and Ors. v. State of Assam, MANU/SC/1505/2011 :
(2012) 2 SCC 34 has held that,
4 4 . The prosecution, it is axiomatic, must establish its case against
the Accused by leading evidence that is accepted by the standards that
are known to criminal jurisprudence regardless whether the crime is
committed in the course of communal disturbances or otherwise. In
short, there can only be one set of Rules and standards when it comes to trials
and judgment in criminal cases unless the statute provides for anything
specially applicable to a particular case or class of cases...
24. In the present case, the cumulative effect of the aforesaid investigative lapses has
fortified the presumption of innocence in favor of the Accused-Respondents. In such
cases, the benefit of doubt arising out of a faulty investigation accrues in favor of the
accused.
25. Although we acknowledge the gravity of the offence alleged against the Accused-
Respondents and the unfortunate fact of a senior official losing his life in furtherance of
his duty we cannot overlook the fact that the lapses in the investigation have disabled
the prosecution to prove the culpability of the accused. The Accused cannot be expected
to relinquish his innocence at the hands of an inefficacious prosecution, which is ridden
with investigative deficiencies. The benefit of doubt arising out of such inefficient
investigation, must be bestowed upon the accused.
2 6 . In our opinion, there exists no perversity in the judgment of the High Court.
Further, in the absence of compelling reasons, this Court is not keen to entertain these
appeals challenging the order of acquittal.
2 7 . We are also not inclined to interfere with the concurrent order of acquittal for
offences committed under the Arms Act and Explosive Substances Act presently before
us in Criminal Appeal No. 1706 of 2014.
2 8 . The appeals are accordingly dismissed. Pending applications, if any, shall also
stand disposed of.","Appellants: State of Uttar Pradesh

CRIMINAL MATTERS - MATTERS FILED BY STATE AGAINST ACQUITTAL
Held,
1. In an appeal against acquittal, appellate court would interfere only where
re exists perversity of fact and law Further, presumption of innocence was
further reinforced against acquitted-accused by having a judgment in his
favor [12]
2. Firstly, it was apt to note that out of seven eye witnesses who participated
i n TIP, five of m identified Accused without committing any mistake. As
observed by Accused No. 3-Respondent, Hazi Atiq had big protruding teeth,
Accused No. 4-Respondent Safat Rasool was suffering from polio hence had
permanent physical disability, but surprisingly this fact was never mentioned
either in F.I.R. or in witness statements. specific identification of four
Accused-Respondents, from a group of 200-300 rioters, with 100%
perfection; without a mention of any distinguishing marks seems highly
improbable considering distance of witnesses from place of occurrence.
Moreover, re existed an inordinate delay of 55 days in conducting TIP of
Accused No. 1 and 2. Although, involvement of Accused No. 3 and 4 was
brought to light on 03.08.2001 itself, prosecution did not take any effort to
arrest or interrogate m for 6 weeks. But no reasonable explanation was
provided for aforesaid inordinate delay. [14]
3. Furthermore, no documentary evidence had been provided to proof that
identity of Accused was kept concealed. On contrary, D.W. 3, Mohd. Shamim
Siddique, Record Keeper in Police Office stated that general diary did not
mention that Accused No. 2-Respondent Mumtaz alias Maulana was kept
baparda. defence also pleaded that, aforesaid inordinate delay was used by
prosecution witnesses to see Accused-Respondents at ir homes or places of
work to mark m carefully for subsequent identification. Additionally, Accused
No. 1-Respondent Wasif Haider, in his statement Under Section 313 Code of
Criminal Procedure went to extent of saying that, prior to TIP he was shown
t o witnesses and his photographs and videotapes were prepared. In Mulla v.
State of U.P., this Court laid down that a TIP had to be conducted timely, if
not, n delay had to be explained and such delay should not cause exposure of
accused. However, in case at hand, not only re was a delay in conducting TIP,
but no explanation for same had been forthcoming from prosecution. This
creates a considerable doubt about genuineness of TIP. [15]
4. Secondly, it was surprising that, although postmortem report described
that, there were only two wounds in body of deceased, one being entry and
other being exit wound, allegedly a bullet was still recovered from ashes of
deceased. F.S.L. report shows that this bullet was charred and blistered. This
recovery of bullet from ashes of deceased was irreconcilable with postmortem
report which allegedly states an exit wound, implying that bullet had
already left body. Aforesaid fact raised a suspicion on both Post-Mortem report
and F.S.L. report as y were incompatible with each other. [16]
5. Thirdly, prosecution had failed to establish that bullet allegedly recovered
from ashes of deceased 20 days later was indeed fired from pistol recovered
from accused-Respondent Wasif Haider. Even, recovery of pistol was doubtful.
While, prosecution case reveals that one. 380 bore pistol colt was recovered
from possession of accused-Respondent Wasif Haider, on contrary, evidence of
P.W. 2-S.O., Rajendra Dhar Dwivedi reveals that one. 320 bore pistol colt was
recovered pursuant to his arrest. Additional contradiction can be seen in
sanction order wherein two pistols of.380 bore were shown to be recovered
from possession of accused-Respondent Wasif Haider. [17]
6. Fourthly, as regards to place of incident, prosecution failed to ascertain
same with precision. While F.I.R. reveals place of occurrence to be in front of
Sunehri Masjid, P.W. 2, complainant later improved over his earlier statement
and stated that, incident actually took place in Noorani Masjid. On contrary,
two site plans show place of incident to be Noorani Masjid. [18]
7. Fifthly, prosecution failed to examine Ram Chandra, orderly of deceased
who was also injured in same incident and had suffered a gunshot injury.
prosecution was also unable to prove injury report of above victim. Such a
failure was fatal to prosecution case as his presence in place of occurrence
was beyond doubt. It had been placed on record that, despite Ram-Chandra
attending proceedings of trial regularly he was not examined by prosecution.
[19]
8. Sixthly, prosecution had also failed to adduce any independent witness.
Even though it was wrong to disbelieve evidence adduced from official
witnesses, but prudence demands that ir evidence needs to tested on altar of
strict scrutiny. Considering aforesaid facts and circumstances, evidences
adduced by prosecution witnesses do not inspire confidence of this Court.
[20]
9. Lastly, it was surprising that although charges had been framed under
Section 307 of IPC, prosecution had absolutely failed to substantiate charges
by means of evidence. It was rather unfortunate that courts below had failed
to take note of same. trial court had erred in convicting Respondents for
aforesaid offence, without any evidence to prove same. [21]
10. Prosecution had failed to link chain of circumstances so as to dispel cloud
of doubt about culpability of Accused-Respondents. It was a well settled
principle that a suspicion, however grave it may be cannot take place of proof,
i.e., re was a long distance between ""may be"" and ""must be"", which must be
traversed by prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt [22]
11. In present case, cumulative effect of aforesaid investigative lapses had
fortified presumption of innocence in favor of Accused-Respondents. In such
cases, benefit of doubt arising out of a faulty investigation accrues in favor of
accused. [24]
12. Although we acknowledge gravity of offence alleged against Accused-
Respondents and unfortunate fact of a senior official losing his life in
furtherance of his duty we cannot overlook fact that lapses in investigation
had disabled prosecution to prove culpability of accused. Accused cannot be
expected to relinquish his innocence at hands of an inefficacious prosecution,
which was ridden with investigative deficiencies. benefit of doubt arising out
of such inefficient investigation, must be bestowed upon accused. [25]
13. There existed no perversity in judgment of High Court. Further, in absence
of compelling reasons, this Court was not keen to entertain these appeals
challenging order of acquittal. [26]
14. Appeals dismissed. [28]",,,,
"Ranjan Gogoi, C.J.I.
1. The issues arising in this group of writ petitions, filed as Public Interest Litigations,
relate to procurement of 36 Rafale Fighter Jets for the Indian Airforce. The procurement
in question, which has been sought to be challenged, has its origins in the post-Kargil
experience that saw a renewed attempt to advance the strategic needs of the armed
forces of the country.
2. As far back as in the month of June of the year 2001, an in-principle approval was
granted for procurement of 126 fighter-jets to augment the strength of the Indian
Airforce. Simultaneously, a more transparent Defence Procurement Procedure (""DPP"")
was formulated for the first time in the year 2002. A robust 'offset clause' was included
in the DPP in the year 2005 so as to promote Indigenisation and to that effect Services
Qualitative Requirements (""SQRs"") were prepared in June 2006. On 29th June 2007 the
Defence Acquisition Council (""DAC"") granted the ""Acceptance of Necessity"" for the
procurement of 126 Medium Multi Role Combat Aircrafts (for short ""MMRCA"") including
18 direct fly-away aircrafts (equivalent to a single squadron) to be procured from the
Original Equipment Manufacturer (""OEM"") with the remaining 108 aircrafts to be
manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (for short ""HAL"") under licence, to be
delivered over a period of 11 years from the date of signing. The bidding process
commenced in August 2007. Six (06) vendors submitted proposals in April, 2008. The
proposals were followed by technical and field evaluations; a Staff Evaluation Report
and a Technical Oversight Committee Report. All these were completed in the year
2011. The commercial bids were opened in November, 2011 and M/s. Dassault Aviation
(hereinafter referred to as ""Dassault"") was placed as the L-I sometime in January 2012.
Negotiations commenced thereafter and continued but without any final result. In the
meantime, there was a change of political dispensation at the centre sometime in the
middle of the year 2014.
3. According to the official Respondents negotiation continued. A process of withdrawal
of the Request for Proposal in relation to the 126 MMRCA was initiated in March 2015.
On 10th April, 2015 an Indo-French joint statement, for acquisition of 36 Rafale Jets in
fly-away condition through an Inter-Governmental Agreement (hereinafter referred to as
""IGA""), was issued and the same was duly approved by the DAC. The Request for
Proposal for the 126 MMRCA was finally withdrawn in June 2015. Negotiations were
carried out and the process was completed after Inter-Ministerial Consultations with the
approval of the Cabinet Committee on Security (for short ""CCS""). The contract along
with Aircraft Package Supply Protocol; Weapons Package Supply Protocol; Technical
Arrangements and Offset contracts was signed in respect of 36 Rafale Jets on 23rd
September, 2016. The aircrafts were scheduled to be delivered in phased manner
commencing from October 2019.
4. Things remained quiet until sometime in the month of September, 2018 when certain
newspapers reported a statement claimed to have been made by the former President of
France, Francois Hollande, to the effect that the French Government were left with no
choice in the matter of selection of Indian Offset Partners and the Reliance Group was
the name suggested by the Government of India. This seems to have triggered of the
writ petitions under consideration.
The first writ petition i.e. Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 225 of 2018 has been filed by one
Shri Manohar Lal Sharma, a practicing lawyer of this Court. What is sought for in the
said writ petition is registration of an FIR under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal
Code, 1860 and a Court Monitored Investigation. The further relief of quashing the
Inter-Governmental Agreement of 2016 for purchase of 36 Rafale Jets has also been
prayed for.
Writ Petition (Civil) No. 1205 of 2018 has been filed by one Shri Vineet Dhanda
claiming to be a public spirited Indian. The Petitioner states that he was inspired to file
the writ petition being agitated over the matter on the basis of the newspaper
articles/reports.
The third writ petition bearing Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 297 of 2018 has been filed
by one Shri Sanjay Singh, a Member of Parliament alleging illegality and nontransparency
in the procurement process. The said writ petition seeks investigation into
the reasons for ""cancellation of earlier deal"" and seeks a scrutiny of the Court into the
alteration of pricing and, above all, how a 'novice' company i.e. Reliance Defence came
to replace the HAL as the Offset partner. Cancellation of Inter-Governmental Agreement
and registration of an FIR has also been prayed for.
The fourth and the last writ petition bearing Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 298 of 2018
has been filed by Shri Yashwant Sinha, Shri Arun Shourie and Shri Prashant Bhushan
claiming to be public spirited Indians. They are aggrieved by non-registration of FIR by
the CBI pursuant to a complaint made by them on 4th October, 2018 which complaint,
according to the Petitioners, disclose a prima facie evidence of commission of a
cognizable offence under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The
prayer, inter alia, made is for direction for registration of an FIR and investigation of the
same and submitting periodic status reports to the Court.
5 . Adequate Military strength and capability to discourage and withstand external
aggression and to protect the sovereignty and integrity of India, undoubtedly, is a
matter of utmost concern for the Nation. The empowerment of defence forces with
adequate technology and material support is, therefore, a matter of vital importance.
6 . Keeping in view the above, it would be appropriate, at the outset, to set out the
parameters of judicial scrutiny of governmental decisions relating to defence
procurement and to indicate whether such parameters are more constricted than what
the jurisprudence of judicial scrutiny of award of tenders and contracts, that has
emerged till date, would legitimately permit.
7 . Parameters of judicial review of administrative decisions with regard to award of
tenders and contracts has really developed from the increased participation of the State
in commercial and economic activity. In Jagdish Mandal v. State of Orissa and Ors.
MANU/SC/0090/2007 : (2007) 14 SCC 517 this Court, conscious of the limitations in
commercial transactions, confined its scrutiny to the decision making process and on
the parameters of unreasonableness and mala fides. In fact, the Court held that it was
not to exercise the power of judicial review even if a procedural error is committed to
the prejudice of the tenderer since private interests cannot be protected while exercising
such judicial review. The award of contract, being essentially a commercial transaction,
has to be determined on the basis of considerations that are relevant to such
commercial decisions, and this implies that terms subject to which tenders are invited
are not open to judicial scrutiny unless it is found that the same have been tailor-made
to benefit any particular tenderer or a class of tenderers. [See Maa Binda Express
Carrier and Anr. v. North-East Frontier Railway and Ors. MANU/SC/1227/2013 :
(2014) 3 SCC 760].
8 . Various Judicial pronouncements commencing from Tata Cellular v. Union of
India MANU/SC/0002/1996 : (1994) 6 SCC 651, all emphasise the aspect that scrutiny
should be limited to the Wednesbury Principle of Reasonableness and absence of mala
fides or favouritism.
9. We also cannot lose sight of the tender in issue. The tender is not for construction of
roads, bridges, etc. It is a defence tender for procurement of aircrafts. The parameter of
scrutiny would give far more leeway to the Government, keeping in mind the nature of
the procurement itself. This aspect was even emphasized in Siemens Public
Communication Networks Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors.
MANU/SC/8245/2008 : (2008) 16 SCC 215. The triple ground on which such judicial
scrutiny is permissible has been consistently held to be ""illegality"", ""irrationality"" and
""procedural impropriety"".
10. I n Reliance Airport Developers (P) Ltd. v. Airports Authority of India and
Ors. MANU/SC/4912/2006 : (2006) 10 SCC 1 the policy of privatization of strategic
national assets qua two airports came under scrutiny. A reference was made in the said
case to the commentary by Grahame Aldous and John Alder in their book 'Applications
for Judicial Review, Law and Practice':
There is a general presumption against ousting the jurisdiction of the courts, so
that statutory provisions which purport to exclude judicial review are construed
restrictively. There are, however, certain areas of governmental activity,
national security being the paradigm, which the courts regard themselves as
incompetent to investigate, beyond an initial decision as to whether the
Government's claim is bona fide. In this kind of non-justiciable area judicial
review is not entirely excluded, but very limited. It has also been said that
powers conferred by the royal prerogative are inherently unreviewable but since
the speeches of the House of Lords in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister
for the Civil Service [MANU/UKHL/0045/1984 : 1985 AC 374 : (1984) 3 WLR
1174 (HL) : (1984) 3 All ER 935] this is doubtful. Lords Diplock, Scaman and
Roskili (sic.)1 appeared to agree that there is no general distinction between
powers, based upon whether their source is statutory or prerogative but that
judicial review can be limited by the subject-matter of a particular power, in
that case national security. Many prerogative powers are in fact concerned with
sensitive, non-justiciable areas, for example, foreign affairs, but some are
reviewable in principle, including where national security is not involved.
Another non-justiciable power is the Attorney General's prerogative to decide
whether to institute legal proceedings on behalf of the public interest.
11. It is our considered opinion/view that the extent of permissible judicial review in
matters of contracts, procurement, etc. would vary with the subject matter of the
contract and there cannot be any uniform standard or depth of judicial review which
could be understood as an across the board principle to apply to all cases of award of
work or procurement of goods/material. The scrutiny of the challenges before us,
therefore, will have to be made keeping in mind the confines of national security, the
subject of the procurement being crucial to the nation's sovereignty.
12. Adopting such an approach, on 10th October, 2018 when the first two writ petitions
were initially listed before the Court, the Court had specifically observed in its order
that it is proceeding in the matter by requiring the Government of India to apprise the
Court of the details of the steps taken in the decision-making process notwithstanding
the fact that the averments in the writ petitions were inadequate and deficient. The
Court had also indicated that it was so proceeding in the matter in order to satisfy itself
of the correctness of the decision-making process. It was also made clear that the issue
of pricing or matters relating to technical suitability of the equipment would not be gone
into by the Court. The requisite information was required to be placed before the Court
by the Government of India in sealed cover. Before the next date of hearing fixed i.e.
31st October, 2018, the other two writ petitions came to be filed.
13. On 31st October, 2018, the Court in its order had recorded that in none of the writ
petitions the suitability of the fighter jets and its utility to the Indian Airforce had been
called into question. Rather what was doubted by the Petitioners is the bona fides of the
decision-making process and the price/cost of the equipment at which it was proposed
to be acquired.
14. Pursuant to the order dated 10th October 2018, a note in sealed cover delineating
the steps in the decision-making process was submitted to the Court and by order dated
31st October 2018 this Court had directed that such of the information which has been
laid before the Court, which can legitimately be brought into the public domain, be also
made available to the Petitioners or their counsels. Details with regard to the induction
of the Indian Offset Partner (IOP), if any, was also required to be disclosed. The Court
also directed that the details with regard to pricing; the advantages thereof, if any,
should also be submitted to the Court in a sealed cover.
15. It is in the backdrop of the above facts and the somewhat constricted power of
judicial review that, we have held, would be available in the present matter that we now
proceed to scrutinise the controversy raised in the writ petitions which raise three broad
areas of concern, namely, (i) the decision-making process; (ii) difference in pricing;
and (iii) the choice of IOP.
Decision Making Process
16. The details of the steps in the decision-making process leading to the award of the
36 Rafale fighter aircrafts' order have been set out in response to the order dated 10th
October, 2018. The Government states that the DPP 2002 has been succeeded by
periodical reviews in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013 and 2016.
The preamble to DPP has been referred to capture its essence, which emphasises that-
Defence acquisition is not a standard open market commercial form of
procurement and has certain unique features such as supplier constraints,
technological complexity, foreign suppliers, high cost, foreign exchange
implications and geo-political ramifications. As a result, decision making
pertaining to defence procurement remains unique and complex.
It also states that-
Defence procurement involves long gestation periods and delay in procurement
will impact the preparedness of our forces. The needs of the armed forces being
a non-negotiable and an uncompromising aspect, flexibility in the procurement
process is required, which has also been provisioned for.
It is DPP 2013 which is stated to have been followed in the procurement in question.
It is no doubt true that paragraph 77 of the DPP 2013 reads as follows:
77. This procedure would be in supersession of Defence Procurement Procedure
2011 and will come into effect from 01 June 2013. There are, however, cases
which would be under various stages of processing in accordance with
provision of earlier versions of DPP at the time of commencement of DPP-2013.
The processing of these cases done so far under the earlier procedure will be
deemed to be valid. Only those cases in which RFP is issued after 01 June,
2013, will be processed as per DPP-2013.
In other words when it is stated that only those cases in which RFP is issued after 1st
June 2013 will be processed as per DPP 2013, in this case where the RFP was issued
much prior to 1st April 2013 and it was withdrawn, as already noted, in June 2015, a
question may arise as to how it could be claimed that DPP 2013 was followed. We,
however, also notice Clause 75 of DPP 2013 which reads as follows:
75. Any deviation from the prescribed procedure will be put up to DAC through
DPB for approval.
17. Also, we notice that the official Respondents have sought support from paragraph
71 of the DPP 2013. Para 71 of DPP 2013, in respect of the IGA has been referred to,
which postulates possibilities of procurement from friendly foreign countries,
necessitated due to geo-strategic advantages that are likely to accrue to the country.
Such procurement would not classically follow the Standard Procurement Procedure or
the Standard Contract Document, but would be based on mutually agreed provisions by
the Governments of both the countries based on an IGA, after clearance from the
Competent Financial Authority (hereinafter referred to as ""CFA""). Of the total
procurement of about Rs. 7.45 lakh crores since 2002 under DPP, different kinds of
IGAs, including Foreign Military Sales and Standard Clauses of Contract account for
nearly 40%. With the object of promoting indigenization, a robust offset Clause is said
to have been included since 2005. As per the Defence Offset Guidelines of 2013, the
vendor/Original Equipment Manufacturer (hereinafter referred to as ""OEM"") is free to
select its IOPs for implementing the offset obligation.
18. As far as the endeavour to procure 126 fighter aircrafts is concerned, it has been
stated that the contract negotiations could not be concluded, inter alia, on account of
unresolved issues between the OEM and HAL. These have been set out as under:
i) Man-Hours that would be required to produce the aircraft in India: HAL
required 2.7 times higher Man-Hours compared to the French side for the
manufacture of Rafale aircraft in India.
ii) Dassault Aviation as the seller was required to undertake necessary
contractual obligation for 126 aircraft (18 direct fly-away and 108 aircraft
manufactured in India) as per RFP requirements. Issues related to contractual
obligation and responsibility for 108 aircraft manufactured in India could not be
resolved.
19. The aforesaid issues are stated to have been unresolved for more than three years.
Such delay is said to have impacted the cost of acquisition, as the offer was with 'inbuilt
escalation' and was influenced by Euro-Rupee exchange rate variations. The
stalemate resulted in the process of RFP withdrawal being initiated in March 2015. In
this interregnum period, adversaries of the country, qua defence issues, inducted
modern aircrafts and upgraded their older versions. This included induction of even 5th
Generation Stealth Fighter Aircrafts of almost 20 squadrons, effectively reducing the
combat potential of our defence forces. In such a situation, government-to-government
negotiations resulted in conclusion of the IGA for the supply of 36 Rafale Aircrafts, as
part of a separate process. The requisite steps are stated to have been followed, as per
DPP 2013. An INT2 was constituted to negotiate the terms and conditions, which
commenced in May 2015 and continued till April 2016. In this period of time, a total of
74 meetings were held, including 48 internal INT meetings and 26 external INT
meetings with the French side. It is the case of the official Respondents that the INT
completed its negotiations and arrived at better terms relating to price, delivery and
maintenance, as compared to the MMRCA offer of Dassault. This was further processed
for inter-ministerial consultations and the approval of the CCS was also obtained,
finally, resulting in signing of the agreement. This was in conformity with the process,
as per para 72 of DPP 2013.
2 0 . The Petitioners, on the other hand, seek to question the very fulfilment of the
prerequisites for entering into an IGA. The Government of France, giving only a 'Letter
of Comfort' and not a 'Sovereign Guarantee' has been questioned.
21. It is a say of the Petitioners that para 71 envisages three eventualities, where the
question of entering into an IGA would arise, which have not arisen in the present case:
(a) Proven technology and capabilities belonging to a friendly foreign country is
identified by our Armed Forces while participating in joint international
exercises;
(b) Large value weapon system/platform in service in a friendly foreign country
is available for transfer or sale normally at a much lesser cost; or
(c) Requirement of procuring a specific state-of-the-art equipment/platform
where the Government of the OEM's country might have imposed restriction on
its sale and thus the equipment cannot be evaluated on 'No Cost No
Commitment' basis.
22. We have studied the material carefully. We have also had the benefit of interacting
with senior Air Force Officers who answered Court queries in respect of different
aspects, including that of the acquisition process and pricing. We are satisfied that there
is no occasion to really doubt the process, and even if minor deviations have occurred,
that would not result in either setting aside the contract or requiring a detailed scrutiny
by the Court. We have been informed that joint exercises have taken place, and that
there is a financial advantage to our nation. It cannot be lost sight of, that these are
contracts of defence procurement which should be subject to a different degree and
depth of judicial review. Broadly, the processes have been followed. The need for the
aircrafts is not in doubt. The quality of the aircraft is not in question. It is also a fact
that the long negotiations for procurement of 126 MMRCAs have not produced any
result, and merely conjecturing that the initial RFP could have resulted in a contract is
of no use. The hard fact is that not only was the contract not coming forth but the
negotiations had come practically to an end, resulting in a recall of the RFP. We cannot
sit in judgment over the wisdom of deciding to go in for purchase of 36 aircrafts in
place of 126. We cannot possibly compel the Government to go in for purchase of 126
aircraft. This is despite the fact that even before the withdrawal of RFP, an
announcement came to be made in April 2015 about the decision to go in only for 36
aircrafts. Our country cannot afford to be unprepared/underprepared in a situation
where our adversaries are stated to have acquired not only 4th Generation, but even 5th
Generation Aircrafts, of which, we have none. It will not be correct for the Court to sit
as an appellate authority to scrutinize each aspect of the process of acquisition.
23. We may also note that the process was concluded for 36 Rafale fighter jet aircrafts
on 23rd September, 2016. Nothing was called into question, then. It is only taking
advantage of the statement by the ex-President of France, Francois Hollande that these
set of petitions have been filed, not only qua the aspect which formed the statement,
that is, the issue of IOPs but also with respect to the entire decision-making process
and pricing. We do not consider it necessary to dwell further into this issue or to seek
clause-by-clause compliances.
Pricing
24. The challenge to the pricing of the aircrafts, by the Petitioners, is sought to be
made on the ground that there are huge escalations in costs, as per the material in
public domain, as found in magazines and newspapers. We did initially express our
disinclination to even go into the issue of pricing. However, by a subsequent order, to
satisfy the conscience of the Court, it was directed that details regarding the costs of
the aircrafts should also be placed in sealed covers before the Court.
25. The material placed before us shows that the Government has not disclosed pricing
details, other than the basic price of the aircraft, even to the Parliament, on the ground
that sensitivity of pricing details could affect national security, apart from breaching the
agreement between the two countries. The pricing details have, however, been shared
with the Comptroller and Auditor General (hereinafter referred to as ""CAG""), and the
report of the CAG has been examined by the Public Accounts Committee (hereafter
referred to as ""PAC""). Only a redacted portion of the report was placed before the
Parliament, and is in public domain. The Chief of the Air Staff is stated to have
communicated his reservation regarding the disclosure of the pricing details, including
regarding the weaponry which could adversely affect national security. The pricing
details are stated to be covered by Article 10 of the IGA between the Government of
India and the Government of France, on purchase of Rafale Aircrafts, which provides
that protection of classified information and material exchanged under the IGA would be
governed by the provisions of the Security Agreement signed between both the
Governments on 25th January, 2008. Despite this reluctance, the material has still been
placed before the Court to satisfy its conscience.
26. We have examined closely the price details and comparison of the prices of the
basic aircraft along with escalation costs as under the original RFP as well as under the
IGA. We have also gone through the explanatory note on the costing, item wise.
Suffice it to say that as per the price details, the official Respondents claim there is a
commercial advantage in the purchase of 36 Rafale aircrafts. The official Respondents
have claimed that there are certain better terms in IGA qua the maintenance and
weapon package. It is certainly not the job of this Court to carry out a comparison of
the pricing details in matters like the present. We say no more as the material has to be
kept in a confidential domain.
Offsets
27. The issue of IOP is what has triggered this litigation. The offset contract is stated to
have been governed by the Defence Offset Guidelines of DPP 2013. Two of the said
contracts were signed with Dassault and M/s. MBDA Missile Systems Limited on 23rd
September, 2016, the same day on which the IGA was signed between the Government
of India and the Government of France. These are the French industrial suppliers of the
Aircraft package and Weapon Package respectively. There are stated to be no offset
obligations in the first three years, but the offset obligations are to commence from
October 2019 onwards.
28. The complaint of the Petitioners is that the offset guidelines contemplate that the
vendor will disclose details about the Indian Offset partner however, in order to help
the business group in India in question, an amendment was carried out in paragraph 8
of the Offset Guidelines that too with retrospective effect. By virtue of the said
amendment it is contended that cloak of secrecy is cast about the Offset partner and the
vendor is enabled to give the details at a much later point of time. It is contended,
however, that other provisions of the Offset Guidelines remain unamended, and,
therefore, Government cannot pretend ignorance about the Indian Offset partner as has
been done in the affidavit filed. It is complained that favouring the Indian business
group has resulted in offence being committed under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
29. As per Clause 8 of DPP 2013, dealing with the processing of offset proposals, it has
been stated in Clause 8.2 as under:
8. Processing of Offset Proposals
8 . 2 The TOEC3 will scrutinize the technical offset proposals (excluding
proposals for Technology Acquisition by DRDO as per para 8.3) to ensure
conformity with the offset guidelines. For this purpose, the vendor may be
advised to undertake changes to bring his offset proposals in conformity with
the offset guidelines. The TOEC will be expected to submit its report within 4-8
weeks of its constitution.
3 0 . It has been categorically stated that the vendor/OEM is yet to submit a formal
proposal, in the prescribed manner, indicating the details of IOPs and products for
offset discharge. A press release in the form of a 'Clarification on Offset Policy', posted
on 22nd September, 2018 has also been placed before us. Inter alia, it states that the
Government reiterates that it has no role to play in the selection of the IOP. As per the
Defence Offset Guidelines, the OEM is free to select any Indian company as its IOP. A
joint venture is stated to have come into being between Reliance Defence and Dassault
in February 2017, which is stated to be a 'purely commercial arrangement' between the
two private companies. Media reports of February 2012 are stated to suggest that
Dassault, within two weeks of being declared the lowest bidder for procurement of 126
aircrafts by the previous Government, had entered into a pact for partnership with
Reliance Industries (Another business group) in the Defence sector. Dassault has also
issued a press release stating that it has signed partnership agreements with several
companies and is negotiating with over hundred other companies. As per the guidelines,
the vendor is to provide details of the IOPs, either at the time of seeking offset credit or
one year prior to discharge of offset obligation, which would be due from 2020
onwards. The aforesaid press release is in conformity with the Clause dealing with IOPs
which reads as under:
4. Indian Offset Partner
4.3 The OEM/vendor/Tier-I sub-vendor will be free to select the Indian offset
partner for implementing the offset obligation provided the IOP has not been
barred from doing business by the Ministry of Defence.
3 1 . Despite the aforesaid illustration, the Petitioners kept on emphasising that the
French Government has no say in the matter, as per media reports. It is also stated that
there was no reason for Dassault to have engaged the services of Reliance Aerostructure
Ltd., through a joint venture, when the company itself had come into being only on 24th
April, 2015. The allegation, thus, is that the Indian Government gave a benefit to
Reliance Aerostructure Ltd., by compelling Dassault to enter into a contract with them,
and that too at the cost of the public enterprise, HAL.
32. It is no doubt true that the company, Reliance Aerostructure Ltd., has come into
being in the recent past, but the press release suggests that there was possibly an
arrangement between the parent Reliance company and Dassault starting from the year
2012. As to what transpired between the two corporates would be a matter best left to
them, being matters of their commercial interests, as perceived by them. There has
been a categorical denial, from every side, of the interview given by the former French
President seeking to suggest that it is the Indian Government which had given no option
to the French Government in the matter. On the basis of materials available before us,
this appears contrary to the Clause in DPP 2013 dealing with IOPs which has been
extracted above. Thus, the commercial arrangement, in our view, itself does not assign
any role to the Indian Government, at this stage, with respect to the engagement of the
IOP. Such matter is seemingly left to the commercial decision of Dassault. That is the
reason why it has been stated that the role of the Indian Government would start only
when the vendor/OEM submits a formal proposal, in the prescribed manner, indicating
details of IOPs and products for offset discharge. As far as the role of HAL, insofar as
the procurement of 36 aircrafts is concerned, there is no specific role envisaged. In fact,
the suggestion of the Government seems to be that there were some contractual
problems and Dassault was circumspect about HAL carrying out the contractual
obligation, which is also stated to be responsible for the non-conclusion of the earlier
contract.
33. Once again, it is neither appropriate nor within the experience of this Court to step
into this arena of what is technically feasible or not. The point remains that DPP 2013
envisages that the vendor/OEM will choose its own IOPs. In this process, the role of the
Government is not envisaged and, thus, mere press interviews or suggestions cannot
form the basis for judicial review by this Court, especially when there is categorical
denial of the statements made in the Press, by both the sides. We do not find any
substantial material on record to show that this is a case of commercial favouritism to
any party by the Indian Government, as the option to choose the IOP does not rest with
the Indian Government.
Conclusion:
34. In view of our findings on all the three aspects, and having heard the matter in
detail, we find no reason for any intervention by this Court on the sensitive issue of
purchase of 36 defence aircrafts by the Indian Government. Perception of individuals
cannot be the basis of a fishing and roving enquiry by this Court, especially in such
matters. We, thus, dismiss all the writ petitions, leaving it to the parties to bear their
own costs. We, however, make it clear that our views as above are primarily from the
standpoint of the exercise of the jurisdiction Under Article 32 of the Constitution of
India which has been invoked in the present group of cases.

HIGH COURT Status:
Judgment challenged vide MANU/SC/1564/2019 dated: 14.11.2019
Facts:
The issues arising in present group of writ petitions, filed as Public Interest
Litigations, related to procurement of 36 Rafale Fighter Jets for the Indian
Airforce. The procurement in question, which has been sought to be
challenged, had its origins in post-Kargil experience that saw a renewed
attempt to advance strategic needs of armed forces of country. In month of
June of year 2001, an in-principle approval was granted for procurement of
126 fighter-jets to augment strength of Indian Airforce. Simultaneously, a
more transparent Defence Procurement Procedure (""DPP"") was formulated for
first time in year 2002. A robust 'offset clause' was included in DPP in year
2005 so as to promote Indigenisation and to that effect Services Qualitative
Requirements (""SQRs"") were prepared in June 2006. On 29th June 2007
Defence Acquisition Council (""DAC"") granted ""Acceptance of Necessity"" for
procurement of 126 Medium Multi Role Combat Aircrafts (""MMRCA"") including
18 direct fly-away aircrafts (equivalent to a single squadron) to be procured
from Original Equipment Manufacturer (""OEM"") with remaining 108 aircrafts
to be manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (for short ""HAL"") under
licence, to be delivered over a period of 11 years from date of signing. Bidding
process commenced in August 2007. Six (06) vendors submitted proposals in
April, 2008. Proposals were followed by technical and field evaluations; a
Staff Evaluation Report and a Technical Oversight Committee Report. All these
were completed in year 2011. Commercial bids were opened in November,
2011 and M/s. Dassault Aviation (""Dassault"") was placed as L-I sometime in
January 2012. Negotiations commenced thereafter and continued but without
any final result. In meantime, there was a change of political dispensation at
centre sometime in middle of year 2014. According to official Respondents
negotiation continued. A process of withdrawal of Request for Proposal in
relation to 126 MMRCA was initiated in March 2015. On 10th April, 2015 an
Indo-French joint statement, for acquisition of 36 Rafale Jets in fly-away
condition through an Inter-Governmental Agreement (""IGA""), was issued and
same was duly approved by D A C. Request for Proposal for 126 MMRCA was
finally withdrawn in June 2015. Negotiations were carried out and process
was completed after Inter-Ministerial Consultations with approval of Cabinet
Committee on Security (""CCS""). Contract along with Aircraft Package Supply
Protocol; Weapons Package Supply Protocol; Technical Arrangements and
Offset contracts was signed in respect of 36 Rafale Jets on 23rd September,
2016. Aircrafts were scheduled to be delivered in phased manner commencing
from October 2019. Things remained quiet until sometime in month of
September, 2018 when certain newspapers reported a statement claimed to
have been made by former President of France, Francois Hollande, to effect
that French Government were left with no choice in matter of selection of
Indian Offset Partners and Reliance Group was name suggested by
Government of India. This seemed to have triggered of writ petitions under
consideration. Writ petition filed registration of an FIR under relevant
provisions of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and a Court Monitored Investigation.
Further relief of quashing Inter-Governmental Agreement of 2016 for
purchase of 36 Rafale Jets had also been prayed for. Controversy raised in
writ petitions raise three broad areas of concern, namely, (i) decision-making
process; (ii) difference in pricing; and (iii) choice of IOP
Held,
1. The tender is not for construction of roads, bridges, etc. It is a defence
tender for procurement of aircrafts. The parameter of scrutiny would give far
more leeway to the Government, keeping in mind the nature of the
procurement itself. This aspect was even emphasized in Siemens Public
Communication Networks Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors. The
triple ground on which such judicial scrutiny is permissible has been
consistently held to be ""illegality"", ""irrationality"" and ""procedural
impropriety"".[9]
2. The extent of permissible judicial review in matters of contracts,
procurement, etc. would vary with the subject matter of the contract and
there cannot be any uniform standard or depth of judicial review which could
be understood as an across the board principle to apply to all cases of award
of work or procurement of goods/material. The scrutiny of the challenges
therefore, will have to be made keeping in mind the confines of national
security, the subject of the procurement being crucial to the nation's
sovereignty. [11]
3. There is no occasion to really doubt the process, and even if minor
deviations have occurred, that would not result in either setting aside the
contract or requiring a detailed scrutiny by the Court. Joint exercises have
taken place, and that there is a financial advantage to the nation. These are
contracts of defence procurement which should be subject to a different
degree and depth of judicial review. Broadly, the processes have been
followed. The need for the aircrafts is not in doubt. The quality of the aircraft
is not in question. It is also a fact that, the long negotiations for procurement
of 126 MMRCAs have not produced any result, and merely conjecturing that
the initial RFP could have resulted in a contract is of no use. It will not be
correct for the Court to sit as an appellate authority to scrutinize each aspect
of the process of acquisition. [22]
4. The process was concluded for 36 Rafale fighter jet aircrafts on 23rd
September, 2016. Nothing was called into question, then. It is only taking
advantage of the statement by the ex-President of France, Francois Hollande
that these set of petitions have been filed, not only qua the aspect which
formed the statement, that is, the issue of IOPs but also with respect to the
entire decision-making process and pricing. [23]
5. The Government has not disclosed pricing details, other than the basic
price of the aircraft, even to the Parliament, on the ground that sensitivity of
pricing details could affect national security, apart from breaching the
agreement between the two countries. The pricing details have, however,
been shared with the Comptroller and Auditor General (hereinafter referred to
as ""CAG""), and the report of the CAG has been examined by the Public
Accounts Committee (""PAC""). Only a redacted portion of the report was placed
before the Parliament, and is in public domain. The Chief of the Air Staff is
stated to have communicated his reservation regarding the disclosure of the
pricing details, including regarding the weaponry which could adversely affect
national security. The pricing details are stated to be covered by Article 10 of
the IGA between the Government of India and the Government of France, on
purchase of Rafale Aircrafts, which provides that protection of classified
information and material exchanged under the IGA would be governed by the
provisions of the Security Agreement signed between both the Governments
on 25th January, 2008. Despite this reluctance, the material has still been
placed before the Court to satisfy its conscience. [25]
6. Once again, it is neither appropriate nor within the experience of this Court
to step into this arena of what is technically feasible or not. The point
remains that Defence Procurement Procedure, (DPP 2013) envisages that the
vendor/OEM will choose its own Indian Offset partners (IOPs). In this
process, the role of the Government is not envisaged and, thus, mere press
interviews or suggestions cannot form the basis for judicial review by this
Court. There is no material on record to show that present is a case of
commercial favouritism to any party by the Indian Government, as the option
to choose the IOP does not rest with the Indian Government. [33]
7. There is no reason for any intervention by this Court on the sensitive issue
of purchase of 36 defence aircrafts by the Indian Government. Perception of
individuals cannot be the basis of a fishing and roving enquiry by this Court,
especially in such matters. Petition dismissed. [34]",,,,
"Jasti Chelameswar, J.
1 . Around 1.45 pm on 27.12.1988, First Information Report No. 244 came to be
registered by Sub-Inspector Kaka Singh (PW5) of Police Station ""Kotwali"" of Patiala
District of the State of Punjab on the basis of information given by one Shri Jaswinder
Singh (PW3). From the narration in the FIR, it appears that the incident which
eventually culminated in the death of Gurnam Singh could have simply passed off as yet
another incident of road rage but for the death of Gurnam Singh. According to the FIR,
around 12.30 p.m., an incident occurred at the traffic light of Battian Wala Chowk in
front of the State Bank of Patiala, Patiala City. Jaswinder Singh (PW3), Avtar Singh
(PW4) and the deceased Gurnam Singh were travelling in Maruti Car No. CH I 8422
driven by the deceased. Both the Accused herein were travelling by vehicle No. PAD
6030. A dispute arose on the right of way between the Accused and the deceased. In
the process the first Accused who is a cricketer of some fame got out of his vehicle,
pulled the deceased out of his vehicle and inflicted fist blows. When PW3 tried to
intervene, the second1 Accused herein got out of the vehicle and gave fist blows to
PW3. Thereafter, they removed the keys of the car of the deceased and fled away from
the scene of occurrence. PW3 and PW4 took Gurnam Singh who was ""in a state of
unconsciousness"" by a rickshaw to a hospital, known as Rajendra Hospital where the
doctors announced that Gurnam Singh was dead.
2. Thereafter, PW3 went to the police station (leaving PW4 in the hospital) and lodged
the FIR.
3 . Case was registered Under Sections 304/34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860
(hereafter referred to as ""IPC"") against the first Accused and un-named second accused.
4. Around 3'O Clock, PW5 reached Rajendra Hospital along with PW3. PW5 prepared the
inquest report, which was attested by PW3 and PW4. The dead body of Gurnam Singh
was sent for post-mortem examination. At about 3.30 p.m., PW3 to PW5 went to the
scene of occurrence where PW5 prepared rough site plan. At 4.30 p.m., post-mortem
examination over the dead body was conducted by PW2. A copy of the FIR was received
by the concerned Magistrate admittedly around 5.30 p.m.
5 . PW2 Dr. Jatinder Kumar Sadana, who conducted the postmortem examination,
recorded two external and one internal injuries:
1) 0.75 cm x 0.5 cm abrasion present over left temporal region at the
injunction of upper part of pinna.
2) 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm abrasion over the front of left knee, and
Subdural hemorrhage present over the left temporal region.
PW2 recorded that the injuries are ante-mortem in nature and caused by 'blunt weapon'.
He opined that the cause of death of Gurnam Singh could be given only after receiving
the report of the pathologist. The pathologist's report dated 09.01.1989 was received in
due course by PW2. Inspite of the pathologist's report, PW2 was not able to give any
definite opinion regarding the cause of death of Gurnam Singh. He, therefore,
addressed a letter dated 11.1.1989 to the Civil Surgeon, Patiala requesting him to refer
the case to the Forensic Expert of Government Medical College, Patiala. In response to
the said request, a Medical Board comprising six members, which included PW1 Dr.
Krishan Vij and PW2, came to be constituted by an office order dated 13.01.1989 of
Principal, Government Medical College, Patiala. PW1 was described therein to be
Convener of the Board.
6 . Thereafter, some correspondence took place between SHO Police Station ""Kotwali""
and PW2. The SHO made an attempt to secure a more precise medical opinion regarding
the cause of death of Gurnam Singh. PW2 declined to give any further opinion
maintaining that ""regarding the opinion whether the injury could be because of fist
blow, any such clarification would be given in the Court.""
7. In the background of the abovementioned facts, a final report (charge-sheet) Under
Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereafter referred to as ""CrPC"")
dated 06.03.1989 came to be filed on 14.07.1989, (i.e. 4 months after its preparation)
Under Section 304 Indian Penal Code, only against the second Accused exonerating the
first accused. On 13 October 1989, the case was committed to Sessions Court, Patiala
by Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Patiala resulting in the registration of Sessions
Case No. 79/89. A charge against A2 Under Section 304 Part-I Indian Penal Code was
framed on 25.09.1990 in Sessions Case No. 79. During the course of the trial, the
Sessions Court after recording the evidence of PW3 thought it fit by its order dated
30.08.1993 to summon the first Accused also to stand trial exercising its power Under
Section 319 Code of Criminal Procedure.
8 . In the meanwhile, on 22.07.1989, PW3 filed a private complaint against both the
Accused for commission of offences Under Section 302/324/323 read with Section 34
Indian Penal Code. A1 was summoned in the said case by an order dated 03.09.1993.
After repeated adjournments, [the reasons for which are not necessary at present], both
the cases were consolidated by an order dated 20.08.1994.
9 . On 20.08.1994, charges were framed against both the accused. Charges Under
Section 304 Part-I Indian Penal Code were framed against both the Accused in case
arising out of the FIR No. 244. Charges Under Section 302 Indian Penal Code against
first Accused and charges Under Section 302/34 Indian Penal Code against second
Accused were framed respectively in complaint case for causing the death of Gurnam
Singh. Charges Under Section 323/34 Indian Penal Code were framed against both the
Accused for causing hurt to PW3. Both the cases were consolidated vide order dated
20.08.1994.
1 0 . In order to establish the guilt of the accused, the prosecution examined five
witnesses and exhibited various documents.2 PW3 and PW4 are said to be eyewitnesses
to the offence. PW1 and PW2 are doctors connected with the postmortem
examination of the dead body of Gurnam Singh. PW5 is the Sub-Inspector who
registered FIR.
11. The Accused examined one witness in their defence i.e. DW1 Raghbir Singh.
12. The Trial Court recorded3:
That, death of Gurnam Singh was not caused by subdural hemorrhage but it
was a case of sudden cardiac death;
That, Gurnam Singh suffered sudden cardiac attack because of which he fell to
the ground and received injury on left temporal region which caused subdural
hemorrhage;
That, it is not certain at what point Gurnam Singh died, but his death was not
due to violence;
Neither Jaswinder Singh (PW3) nor Avtar Singh (PW4) are truthful witnesses
because there appears to be no corroboration of their presence with Gurnam
Singh.
and, therefore, concluded that the prosecution has failed to establish the case beyond
reasonable doubt and acquitted both the Accused herein.
13. The matter was carried in two appeals to the High Court by the State and also by
the complainant. The High Court reversed the acquittal and found both the Accused
guilty Under Section 304 Part-II and 304 Part-II read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code
respectively for causing the death of Gurnam Singh. Apart from the above, A-2 was also
found guilty for an offence Under Section 323 Indian Penal Code for causing injuries to
PW3.
14. Hence, these three appeals-Criminal Appeal No. 58 of 2007 filed by Rupinder Singh
Sandhu (A-2); Criminal Appeal No. 59 of 2007 filed by Navjot Singh Sidhu (A-1); and
Criminal Appeal No. 60 of 2007 filed by Shri Jaswinder Singh (PW3).
15. Shri R.S. Cheema and Shri R. Basant, learned senior Counsel appeared for A-1 and
A-2 respectively. Shri Siddhartha Luthra and Shri Ranjit Kumar, learned senior Counsel,
appeared for the de facto complainant (PW3 Jaswinder Singh). Shri Nidhesh Gupta,
learned senior Counsel, appeared for A-1 in the appeal filed by PW3 Jaswinder Singh.
Shri Sangram S. Saron, Advocate appeared for the State.
16. Enormous submissions are made before us by each of the learned senior Counsel
mentioned above.
17. Some of the submissions made by the three learned senior Counsel for the Accused
are common. Briefly stated they are:
i. the conclusion of acquittal recorded by the Trial Court is not to be interfered
with by the appellate Court unless there are compelling reasons warranting
interference;
ii. there are no such circumstances in the case on hand which warranted
interference by the High Court with the conclusion of acquittal recorded by the
Trial Court;
iii. merely because a second view is possible to be taken on the material on
record, the Appellate Court is not justified in reversing the conclusion of
acquittal and in this case that is exactly what happened; and
iv. the conclusion of the Trial Court that PW3 and
PW4 are not truthful witnesses is based on cogent reasoning. The High Court
has not recorded any tenable reasons to demonstrate that the conclusion of the
Trial Court is manifestly illegal;
18. Apart from the abovementioned submissions made in common on behalf of both the
Accused it was submitted on behalf of A-1:
i) the medical evidence on record does not corroborate the evidence of PW3
and PW4, a factor which has been strongly relied upon by the Trial Court to
disbelieve PW3 and PW4. The High Court did not record any cogent reasons for
reversing the Trial Court's opinion; and
ii) the medical opinion on record does not clearly establish the exact cause of
death of Gurnam Singh. In the absence of clear medical opinion regarding the
cause of death, one of the essential elements of the offence of culpable
homicide Under Section 299 Indian Penal Code, it cannot be said that the bodily
injury alleged to have been caused by A-1 resulted in the death of Gurnam
Singh.
19. On behalf of the second accused, it is additionally argued that the prosecution is
required to prove by credible evidence (i) that A-2 was present along with A-1 and
participated in the incident, and (ii) the exact nature of his participation, and (iii) he
shared a common intention with A-1 to commit an offence Under Section 299 Indian
Penal Code.
There is absolutely no credible evidence on record to establish the above. The High
Court neither examined any one of the above mentioned questions nor gave any reason
whatsoever to reverse the conclusion of the Trial Court insofar as it relates to A-2.
20. Before a man can be convicted of a crime, it is usually necessary for the
prosecution to prove that a certain event or a certain state of affairs which is
forbidden by the criminal law has been caused by his conduct and that this
conduct was accompanied by a prescribed state of mind. The event or state of
affairs is usually called the actus reus and the state of mind, the mens rea of
the crime. Both these elements must be proved beyond reasonable doubt by
the prosecution.4
21. Both the Accused are convicted for the offence prescribed Under Section 299 Indian
Penal Code while A-1 was found guilty of the offence simpliciter, A-2 was found
vicariously guilty5 of that offence with the aid of Section 34 Indian Penal Code. The
accusation being that they caused the death of Gurnam Singh by their conduct
accompanied by the requisite mens rea and such conduct constitutes the offence
prescribed Under Section 299 Indian Penal Code.
22. The question is whether the High Court is right in holding that all the requisite
elements to find the Accused guilty of the offences for which they were tried are proved
beyond reasonable doubt? To hold either of the Accused guilty for an offence Under
Section 299 Indian Penal Code either simpliciter or vicariously with the aid of Section
34 Indian Penal Code, it is required to be proved that each of the two Accused was
present and participated in the incident and caused injuries which resulted in the death
of Gurnam Singh.
23. The undisputed fact is that Gurnam Singh was declared to have been brought dead
to the Rajendra Hospital around 12.45 pm on the fateful day. According to the
prosecution (FIR), Gurnam Singh received fist blows from A-1 around 12.30 pm and
became unconscious. The FIR is conspicuously silent about any physical attack by A-2
on Gurnam Singh.
To find either of the two Accused guilty of the offence Under Section 299 Indian Penal
Code, it must be proved that Gurnam Singh died as a consequence of the physical
attack and the resulting injuries therefrom. We shall defer the examination of the
medical evidence regarding the cause of death of Gurnam Singh for the time being and
proceed on the basis that the death was homicidal as a consequence of the injuries
received by him. The question is-who caused the injuries?
24. Prosecution sought to prove the presence, identity and participation of both the
Accused in the crime by the evidence of PWs 3 and 4-cited as eye-witnesses to the
offence. They asserted in their evidence that they were travelling on the fateful day
along with the deceased and witnessed the occurrence. However, the Trial Court
recorded a conclusion that neither of them is a ""truthful witness"" because ""there
appears to be no corroboration of their presence with Gurnam Singh"". The conclusion of
the Trial Court is based on the following factors:
i. both the witnesses (PW3 and PW4) are related to each other and the
deceased;
ii. though the incident took place at a very busy location in the city of Patiala in
broad day light, no independent witness was examined by the prosecution to
corroborate the evidence of PW3 and PW4;
iii. police did not either seize the vehicle in which the deceased and PWs 3 & 4
were said to be travelling at the time of the incident nor the site plan of the
scene of occurrence prepared by the police indicate the presence of the car;
iv. there were inconsistencies in the evidence of both PWs 3 & 4 regarding the
number of the vehicle in which the Accused were travelling at the time of the
occurrence and also regarding the fact as to which one of the Accused was
driving the said vehicle. The number and the driver's name given by them in
evidence is not the same as the number and the name of the driver given in the
FIR;
v. the version of the prosecution that PW3 was the injured witness is not
believable. It is only an attempt to create evidence that PW3 too had been
present and attacked by the accused; and
vi. though the witnesses deposed that they accompanied the deceased Gurnam
Singh on the fateful day and were proceeding to the bank to withdraw some
cash, no corroborating material, such as, cheque book etc. has been placed on
record to substantiate the version of the witnesses.
25. On the other hand, the High Court held-(i) both PW3 and PW4 deposed consistently
regarding the incident, (ii) that they had no past enmity with the Accused to falsely
implicate the accused, not even a suggestion of the existence of any such motive was
made to PWs 3 and 4 in the cross-examination; and, (iii) the inconsistencies with
regard to the number of vehicle by which the Accused were travelling and which one of
the Accused was driving the vehicle are immaterial. Therefore, the High Court opined
that they are trustworthy witnesses.
26. It is argued before us on behalf of the Accused that; according to the prosecution
case, Gurnam Singh was carried from the scene of occurrence to the hospital in
Rickshaw by PW3 and PW4. Neither the Rickshaw puller was examined nor any record of
the hospital is proved to establish that PW3 and PW4 accompanied Gurnam Singh to
Rajendra Hospital. The said facts coupled with various other discrepancies noticed by
the Trial Court in assessing truthfulness of the evidence of PW3 and PW4, make it highly
unsafe to convict the Accused on the basis of such evidence.
27. Having regard to the material on record and the submissions made, we are of the
opinion that the case of each of the two Accused are to be considered separately.
28. We shall first deal with the case of the second Accused Rupinder Singh Sandhu
because, in our opinion, his case can be decided without examining any one of the
common submissions made on behalf of the accused.
2 9 . In the entire judgment of the High Court, there are only two sentences which
mention the name of the second accused. There is no discussion in the judgment of the
High Court as to at what point of time during the course of investigation, A-2 was
identified to be the other clean shaven person travelling with A-1 on the fateful day and
what is the evidence on the basis of which the prosecution reached such conclusion
except the statements (made after 7 years after the event) of PW-3 and PW-4 made at
the time of the trial. It is unfortunate that the High Court thought it fit to reverse the
acquittal recorded by the Sessions Court and to convict A-2 for an offence Under
Section 304 Part II read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code on the basis of such
frivolous analysis.6
30. For the purpose of deciding the case of A2, we presume that PWs 3 and 4 were
accompanying Gurnam Singh on the fateful day and witnessed the incident. The
interesting feature of the case is that the FIR mentioned the name of only A1 and the
second participant in the incident is said to be a ""clean shaven man"". The FIR does not
mention that the clean shaven man either attacked or inflicted any injury on the body of
Gurnam Singh. It only mentions that he inflicted fist blows on PW3. The material on
record is absolutely bereft of the information regarding the fact as to at which point of
time A-2 was identified to be that 'clean shaven man' who participated in the incident
along with A-1 by the investigating agency. Nor is there any material on record to
indicate the basis on which the prosecution came to the conclusion that A-2 is that
clean shaven man.
PW3 and PW4 were examined at the time of inquest over the dead body of Gurnam
Singh, which took place according to the prosecution at 3.30 p.m. on the date of
occurrence. Even those statements of PW3 and PW4 do not mention the name or
identifiable description of A-2.
Admittedly, at no point of time a test identification parade was held to establish the
identity of the clean shaven man to be A-2. The only material on record to connect A-2
with the offences is the evidence of PW3 and PW4 at the trial where they deposed that
A-2 is that clean shaven person who was present along with A-1 on the date of the
incident.
The evidence of PW-3 was recorded on two occasions, initially on 9.7.1993 in the
Sessions case arising out of the police report at which point of time only A-2 was put to
trial for various offences in connection with the incident which resulted in the death of
Gurnam Singh.
PW-3 deposed at that point of time as follows:
The Accused present in Court Rupinder Singh was not known to me prior to the
occurrence.
Again, he was examined on 16.8.1995 at the joint trial of both the sessions cases
against both the Accused herein. In the chief examination, he stated;
I observed that one clean shaven person whose name was Rupinder Singh
Sandhu was found sitting on the driver seat. The witness has pointed out
towards Rupinder Singh Sandhu Accused now present in the Court.
And further as follows:
Thereafter Rupinder Singh (Sandhu) Accused came out from the Gypsy and he
started causing me injuries with fist blows. Rupinder Singh (Sandhu)
gave fist blows on the left inside of my chest and on the left side of my
forehead.
The relevant portion of the cross examination reads as follows:
I stated in Ex. PQ that thereafter Rupinder Singh (Sandhu) came out from the
Gypsy. Attention of the witness has been drawn to Ex. PQ where name of
Rupinder Singh (Sandhu) has not been mentioned. The narration of that the
clean shaven man came out of the vehicle. I stated in Ex. PQ that Rupinder
Singh (Sandhu) gave fist blows on the left side of my chest and on the left
side of my forehead. Attention of the witness has been drawn to Ex. PQ
where the portion 'attacked' by Rupinder Singh (Sandhu) have not been
mentioned. Narration is that Rupinder Singh (Sandhu) gave fist blows to him.
31. From our analysis of the above material, the following conclusions emerge:
(i) Neither PW3 nor PW4 knew the second Accused prior to the date of the
offence;
(ii) Even on the date of the offence they did not know his name or other
particulars which could lead to his identification;
(iii) The prosecution did not bring on record any material to establish as to how
they came to the conclusion that the person accompanying the first Accused is
Rupinder Singh Sandhu (A-2);
(iv) The only evidence to connect A-2 with the crime is the statements of PWs 3
and 4 made at the time of the trial (some 7 years after the incident) that A-1
was the other person accompanying A-1 on the fateful day;
(v) There is nothing either in the deposition of PW3 or PW4 that A2 ever
attacked the deceased; and
(vi) There is no other evidence on record to show that A-2 attacked the
deceased.
These aspects are not considered by the Trial Court obviously because the Trial Court
opined that PW3 and PW4 are not truthful witnesses. Nor did the High Court examine
these aspects while reversing the acquittal order of the Trial Court. In the impugned
judgment of the High Court, there is no discussion regarding the identity of A-2 or the
role played by him in the incident. Without any discussion whatsoever regarding the
evidence either to prove the presence of A-2 along with A-1 at the time of the
occurrence or the role played by A-2 in the incident insofar as it pertained to the death
of Gurnam Singh, the High Court chose to record a finding of guilt against A-2 Under
Section 304 Part-II read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code. It must be remembered that
the evidence of PW3 and PW4 was recorded some 7 years after the incident. The first
time PW3 ever identified the other clean shaven man accompanying A-1 on the fateful
day to be A-2 was on 9.7.1993 at the trial of the Sessions Case in Crime No. 244. Even
by then some 5 years had elapsed from the date of offence.
32. The High Court abruptly recorded a conclusion that A-2 is guilty of an offence of
Section 304 Part-II read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code. Such a conclusion in our
view is wholly unsustainable. Even if we believe for the sake of argument (we
emphasise only for the sake of argument) that A-2 was present with A-1 at the time of
the incident, there is nothing on record to prove that he attacked Gurnam Singh or that
he shared a common intention with A-1 to commit the offence of culpable homicide not
amounting to murder.
The conclusion of the High Court that A-2 is also guilty of the offence Under Section
323 Indian Penal Code is equally unsustainable in view of our discussion above,
especially in view of the fact that there is no trustworthy evidence regarding his
presence along with A-1 at the time of the offence. It is not safe to convict A-2 on the
basis of the evidence of PWs 3 and 4.
We therefore, set aside the judgment of the High Court insofar as A2 is concerned.
33. We shall now deal with the case of first accused. Once again it is necessary to
examine whether the death of Gurnam Singh is caused by A-1 as alleged by the
prosecution. For recording any conclusion against A-1 in this regard, first, it is
necessary to know exactly what is the cause of death of Gurnam Singh, and second,
that the conduct of A-1 in inflicting the fist blows on Gurnam Singh resulted in the
death of Gurnam Singh. Even if both the above-mentioned factors are established
beyond reasonable doubt, it must further be proved that A-1 had the requisite mens rea
to commit the crime defined under either Section 299 or Section 300, Indian Penal
Code.
34. We now examine each one of the above questions.
To hold A-1 guilty of causing the death of Gurnam Singh, it must be proved that (i) he
inflicted fist blows on Gurnam Singh as alleged by the prosecution; and (ii) the injuries
resulting from the fist blows caused the death of Gurnam Singh.
3 5 . In order to establish the fact that A-1 inflicted fist blows on Gurnam Singh,
prosecution relied upon the evidence of PWs 3 and 4 who claimed that they were
travelling along with Gurnam Singh at the time of the occurrence in the car driven by
Gurnam Singh and, therefore, witnessed the occurrence.
The Sessions Court disbelieved the evidence of PWs 3 and 4 principally on two grounds,
firstly that the evidence of PW3 and PW4 was not consistent and kept varying from time
to time and secondly, the medical evidence does not corroborate the testimonies of PWs
3 and 4. On the other hand, as already noticed by us (at para 25), the High Court
disagreed with the conclusion of the Sessions Court regarding the trustworthiness of the
evidence of PWs 3 and 4.
3 6 . The submission of the A-1 is that PWs 3 and 4 are planted witnesses and the
circumstances appearing from the record create any amount of doubt regarding the fact
that:
PWs 3 and 4 were in fact travelling with Gurnam Singh and witnessed the
offence,
According to A-1, the circumstances are:
(i) PWs 3 and 4 were related to the deceased and therefore they are
interested witnesses.
(ii) The failure of the prosecution to examine any independent witness
(i.e. witness unconnected with the deceased) though a good number of
people must have witnessed the occurrence as it occurred in broad day
light in the city of Patiala.
(iii) Non-production of the records of the hospital7 to indicate that
Gurnam Singh was taken to the hospital by PWs 3 and 4.
(iv) The fact that the FIR which is said to have been registered by PW5
at 1.45 pm at the instance of PW3 reached the concerned Magistrate
only at 5.30 pm that evening (i.e. approximately after a lapse of 4
hours) though the distance between the police station and the
Magistrate is only two kilometers leads to a doubt that the timing of the
registration of the FIR is manipulated to give the impression that the
incident was promptly reported. The purpose being to plant PWs 3 and
4 as eye-witnesses to the occurrence.
(v) That the prosecution did not seize the vehicle by which deceased,
PW3 and PW4 were said to have been traveling.
37. We shall now examine the tenability of the above submissions.
38. The fact that PWs 3 and 4 are related to the deceased Gurnam Singh is not in
dispute. The existence of such relationship by itself does not render the evidence of
PWs 3 and 4 untrustworthy. This Court has repeatedly held so and also held that the
related witnesses are less likely to implicate innocent persons exonerating the real
culprits.8
39. Admittedly, the incident took place in broad daylight in a busy area of Patiala city.
Obviously, the incident would have been witnessed by many others. It is, therefore, the
submission of the Accused that the non-examination of any person other than PWs 3
and 4 renders the evidence of PWs 3 and 4 untrustworthy.
We find it difficult to accept the submission. The mere fact that some more witnesses,
who would have witnessed the occurrence, were not examined does not render the
evidence of PWs 3 and 4 untrustworthy. In fact, in a matter like this, examining any
other witness who was supposed to have witnessed the offence would increase the
burden of the prosecution to establish that such a witness is not a chance witness.
40. Coming to the submission that the relevant records of Rajendra Hospital to which
Gurnam Singh was taken immediately after the incident were not proved to establish
that PWs 3 and 4 were the persons who carried Gurnam Singh to the hospital need not
necessarily lead to the conclusions that PWs 3 and 4 were not trustworthy witnesses. No
doubt, the production of such record would have gone to corroborate the fact that PWs
3 and 4 were accompanying Gurnam Singh at the time of the incident and immediately
thereafter. Corroboration is not required for every fact sought to be proved by the
prosecution. If a fact is proved by some credible evidence, to insist upon further
corroborating material would only make the enforcement of criminal law an absurdity.
41. Another submission of the defence is that PWs 3 and 4 are planted witnesses by the
prosecution, though they did not actually witness the occurrence of the crime. The
Accused seek to raise a doubt regarding the fact that FIR is registered at 1.45 p.m.
because the FIR reached the Magistrate around 5.30 p.m. The concerned court,
admittedly, is only at a distance of 2 to 3 kilometers from the police station. It is,
therefore, argued that the prosecution manipulated the time of the registration of the
FIR though it was recorded at a much later point of time after procuring the presence of
PWs 3 and 4 to figure as eye-witnesses.
In our opinion, the logic adopted by the Accused suggesting the possibility of the PWs 3
and 4 being planted witnesses is untenable.
Admittedly, the post-mortem was conducted by PW2 on the dead body of Gurnam Singh
at 4.30 p.m. on the date of the occurrence. PW2 in his deposition stated that body was
identified by PWs 3 and 4. The post-mortem report also mentions the fact that body was
identified by PWs 3 and 4. It, therefore, follows that PWs 3 and 4 were present by 4.30
p.m. i.e., at the time of the post mortem. No submission is made that PW2 is not a
trustworthy witness or that the post-mortem report is not a reliable document.
The post-mortem was preceded by an inquest conducted by PW5 (sub-Inspector Kaka
Singh). He deposed that on receipt of the report of PW3 around 1.45 p.m. after
completing the formalities of registration of the FIR, he proceeded to Rajendra Hospital
at 3.00 p.m. Thereafter, he prepared the inquest report (Ex. PH) in the presence of PWs
3 and 4 who attested the inquest report. After completion of the inquest, PW5 entrusted
the dead body to two police constables namely Bahadur Singh and Gurpal Singh with a
requisition for post mortem (Ex. PG).
Obviously, it takes some time to conduct inquest. If PW5 reached the Rajendra Hospital
at 3.00 p.m., the time gap of one and half hours between the commencement of the
inquest and the commencement of the post-mortem cannot be said to be an
unreasonable period for conducting the inquest and making appropriate arrangement for
the post-mortem examination.9 Both from the inquest report and the post mortem
report, it can be noticed that PWs 3 and 4 presence was mentioned. Under Section 174
Code of Criminal Procedure, an officer in charge of police station receiving information
of the death of a person under the circumstances specified in the said Section is
required to proceed to the place where the dead body is, draw up a report of the
apparent cause of death and then forward the dead body for (post mortem) examination
to the nearest Civil Surgeon. Therefore, neither the inquest could have taken place
without the registration of the crime nor the post mortem examination could be
undertaken without a requisition from the investigating officer. There is nothing in the
examination of PW5 (SI) to suggest that he did not follow the procedure prescribed
Under Section 174, Code of Criminal Procedure.
From the above, it follows at least by 3 p.m. PWs 3 and 4 were present and actively
associated with the above-mentioned events. If they were to be planted as eyewitnesses,
it must have happened between 12.30 and 3.00 p.m. That means in a gap of
two and a half hours between 12.30 p.m. to 3.00 p.m., the investigating officer must
have identified PWs 3 and 4 to be witnesses who would act to the dictation of the
investigating agency and support the version of the prosecution and plant them. Such a
theory in our opinion would be a fantastic piece of fiction and it pre-supposes that PW-5
for some unknown reasons bore an enmity to A1 to plan such a deep plot to implicate
A-1 in the crime. In the process, we must not forget that A-1, even by the date of the
occurrence, was some kind of a celebrity. We would find it difficult to believe such a
version. The general tendency-if we do not take leave of common sense-is to turn a
blind eye to the violations of law committed by celebrities.
42. Another aspect of the matter which was vehemently argued by the learned Counsel
for the Accused is that the non-seizure of the vehicle by which the deceased and the
PWs 3 and 4 were said to have been travelling at the time of the occurrence throws
doubt about the presence of PWs 3 and 4 along with the deceased at the time of the
occurrence. We fail to understand the submission. Even if the vehicle were to be seized,
we do not understand how it would go to prove the fact that PWs 3 and 4 were also
travelling by that vehicle.
43. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the Sessions Court was wrong and the High
Court was right (though the reasons are not well articulated) in believing the presence
of PWs 3 and 4 at the time of the commission of the offence along with deceased
Gurnam Singh. We must hasten to add that from the above finding it does not follow
that their entire evidence is unimpeachable.
44. Then it becomes necessary to examine as to what extent the evidence of PWs 3 and
4 is credible. Both the witnesses in their evidence before the Sessions Court stated that
they travelled with the deceased on the fateful day in a Maruti car driven by Gurnam
Singh. Both of them stated that there was an altercation between A-1 and the deceased
regarding the right of way which resulted in the 1st Accused giving fist blows to
Gurnam Singh. They did not make any allegation in their evidence that A-2 attacked
Gurnam Singh. Their version is that when they tried to intervene to rescue Gurnam
Singh, the 2nd Accused attacked PW-3 by giving fist blows.
Though, it is the evidence of PWs 3 and 4 that A-1 inflicted fist blows on Gurnam Singh,
the post-mortem report indicates only two external injuries-one on the temporal region
and Anr. on the left knee of the deceased-both are abrasions. The 2nd injury, i.e.
abrasion on the knee, according to PW-2 could be the result of the fall. Notwithstanding
the narration of PWs 3 and 4 that A-1 inflicted fist blows (multiple blows), it is most
unlikely that a person would simultaneously aim at the head and also the knees of the
victim while giving fist blows. Of course, it is possible that A-1 delivered more than one
fist blow but only one of them landed on the head of Gurnam Singh and the others
missed the target. That leaves us with the position that A-1 inflicted a single injury on
the head of the deceased and we can safely conclude that the 2nd injury on the knee of
the deceased occurred due to a fall at any road. It is not the suggestion of the
prosecution that Gurnam Singh died of the injury on his knee.
4 5 . The injury on the head of Gurnam Singh, as already noticed, is an abrasion
admeasuring 0.75 cm x 0.5 cm over the left temporal region at the junction of upper
part of pinna. There is a corresponding subdural hemorrhage present over the left
temporal region of Gurnam Singh. But the question is whether that single injury caused
the death of Gurnam Singh.
46. PW-2 in the post-mortem report did not give any opinion regarding the cause of the
death of Gurnam Singh. On the other hand, he recorded as follows:
The cause of death in this case will be given after receiving the report from the
Pathologist, Government Medical College, Patiala. Both the injuries are antemortem
in nature and caused by blunt weapon.
It is significant to note that PW2 was of the opinion that the injuries were ante-mortem
in nature and caused by a blunt weapon.
47. The pathologist gave a report dated 9.1.89 (Ex. PJ). He noticed a large number of
abnormalities in the condition of the heart of Gurnam Singh.
Heart weighed 430 gm and measured 12 x 8 x 6 cm. Epicardial fat was
increased, especially over right ventricle. Both the branches of left coronary
artery i.e. anterior descending branch and circumflex branch and right coronary
artery showed atherosclerosis with calcification and narrowing of the lumen.
Maximum thickness of left ventricular wall was increased to 1.8 cm.
Myocardium showed stromal fat infiltration, especially of right ventricle and
multiple focus areas of fibrosis in the wall of left ventricle. Cusps and chambers
of the ears showed no Pathology. No evidence of myocardial infarction was
seen.
Root of aorta showed atherosclerosis with focal areas of calcification.
Insofar as the brain is concerned, the pathology report reads as follows:
Four pieces of brain, covered with Pia Meter, together weighed 550 gms and
measured 11 x 11 x 5 cm. No pathology was seen on gross or Microscopic
examination.
It is relevant to note that the pathologist did not notice any pathology either on the
gross or microscopic examination. On receipt of the pathology report, PW-2 opined that
it is necessary to obtain a further opinion of forensic expert. He, therefore, wrote to the
Civil Surgeon, Patiala on 11.1.89 requesting that the case be referred to forensic expert,
Government Medical College, Patiala.
4 8 . On 13.1.89, the Principal, Government Medical College, Patiala, acting on the
abovementioned letter dated 11.1.89, constituted a Board consisting of 6 members of
whom two were examined as PWs 1 and 2 in the trial of the case. PW-1 was designated
as the Convener of the said Medical Board. PW-1 gave a very cryptic opinion (Ex. PA)
on 17.1.89, as follows:
Death in this case is attributed to the effects of head injury and cardiac
condition. However, the head injury in itself could be sufficient to cause death
in the ordinary course of nature.
49. In view of the lack of clarity in the opinion, the prosecution time and again sought
for a clarification of the opinion. On two occasions, i.e. on 31.1.89 and 3.2.89, PW-1
declined to give any further clarification and communicated as follows:
In this context, it is for your kind information that the opinion expressed earlier
stands as such.
This is for your kind information that the facts regarding the case have already
been stated and need not be asked over and again. If any clarification is
needed, that will be submitted in the Court.
50. The Sessions Court analysed the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 and the above mentioned
correspondence between the investigating officer and the doctors from paras 33 to 36
and recorded:
... That there was a very minor abrasion over the left temporal region, there
was no fracture of the skull, the sub-dural hemorrhage seen by Dr. Jatinder
Kumar Sadana (PW-2) had not been measured as its magnitude and size was
not indicated in the post mortem report. The witness in cross-examination
admitted that a sub-dural hemorrhage is not fatal in all the cases.
xxx xxx xxx
Dr. Gurpreet Singh10, Head of the Cardiology Department was of the view that
the cardiac condition as reported by the Pathologist could also result in sudden
cardiac death under stress. This means that Gurnam Singh could well have
suddenly died without any external injury on account of a Neurogenic or
vasovagal shock and the post mortem examination would not have revealed this
fact. It was only after the pathologist examined xx the heart of the patient and
reported various medical defects therein that the Cardiologist formed the
opinion that it was a case of sudden cardiac death.
xxx xxx xxx
In any case, the Board has not stated that death was the result of the head
injury or death was the result of cardiac condition or death was the result of
head injury coupled with the cardiac condition or death was the result of head
injury which led to the cardiac condition.
and finally held:
Conclusion on the basis of the medical evidence is that the deceased died on
account of sudden cardiac death under stress, fell and received the two
abrasions including the subdural hemorrhage in question. This conclusion is
quite consistent with the medical opinion expressed by the Pathologist and by
Dr. Krishan Vij and Dr. Jatinder Kumar Sadana.
51. On the other hand, the High Court recorded a conclusion, as follows:
..........None of the doctors i.e. Dr. Krishan Vij PW-1 and Dr. Jatinder Kumar
Sadana PW-2 have stated in their testimony that the mode of death of Gurnam
Singh was cardiac failure. All they have stated is that by going through the
report of the Pathologist, the cardiac condition of heart of Gurnam Singh was
very weak. We cannot be oblivious of the fact that on the opening of the skull,
subdural hemorrhage was present over the left parietal region and brain as
spelt out by Dr Jatinder Kumar Sadana PW-2. It is in fact this hemorrhage
which caused the death of Gurnam Singh, and not a cardiac arrest.
52. It is submitted by the Accused that the above conclusion of the High Court is not
based on any evidence and is a pure conjecture.
53. We have already noticed that PW2, who conducted the postmortem, did not identify
the cause of death of Gurnam Singh. He only forwarded the opinion of the Medical
Board to the Police.11 PW-1, who headed the Board, simply repeated the statement
made in Exhibit PA.
Deposition of PW 1: After perusal of the record and the discussions held,
opinion was given which is Ex. PA. According to Ex. PA the death in this case
was attributed to the effects of the head injury and cardiac arrest. However, the
head injury in itself could be sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of
nature.
On the face of the above evidence, the High Court came to the conclusion that it is the
subdural hemorrhage which caused the death of Gurnam Singh and not cardiac arrest.
54. As rightly pointed out by the accused, we find no basis in the evidence on record
for such a conclusion. When Exhibit PA says that death in the case is ""attributed to the
effects of head injury and cardiac condition"", to conclude that the cause of death is only
hemorrhage and not cardiac arrest is contrary to the evidence on record. On the other
hand it must be remembered the pathologist reported that he did not notice any
pathology on the brain either on ""gross or microscopic examination"". PW-2, who
conducted the post-mortem examination, did not give any description of the
hemorrhage except to state that subdural hemorrhage existed in the parietal region. He
admitted in the cross examination that he did not mention the magnitude or size of the
haemorrhage.12
55. PW-1 is also the author of a textbook on Forensic Medicine and Toxicology. In the
Sixth Edition of his book he stated as follows:
On most occasions, bleeding is slight but fatal compression of the brain by a
large subdural haemorrhage can occur within a few hours. It has been
suggested that about 100-150 ml is usually the minimum associated with
fatalities. Fatality is frequently associated with some concomitant brain injury.
If there is no primary brain damage, the mortality from the subdural
haemorrhage is usually related to the victim's age, neurological status and
delay from the time of trauma to the surgical evacuation of the haematoma.13
It can be noticed from the above statement-(i) subdural hemorrhage by itself does not
cause death but it is the compression of brain caused by a large subdural hemorrhage
which causes the death; and (ii) about 100-150 ml of hemorrhage is usually the
minimum associated with fatalities.
56. We shall assess the evidence on record in the instant case in light of the above
analysis. The statements made in (Ex PA) and the evidence of PW1 that the head injury
itself could be sufficient to cause the death in the ordinary course of nature are mere
ipse dixit. Neither any specific details regarding the volume of the subdural hemorrhage
are available on record, nor any medical opinion that the subdural hemorrhage caused
the compression of the brain that caused the death of Gurnam Singh. There is no
evidence of any concomitant brain injury. The post-mortem report and the evidence of
PW2 are silent in this regard. The pathologist's report is clear about the absence of any
pathology in brain. Such being the evidence on record, the conclusion of the High Court
that Gurnam Singh's death is caused by subdural hemorrhage but not cardiac arrest, in
our opinion, is not based on any evidence on record and is a pure conjecture. We,
therefore, find it difficult to sustain the conviction of the first Accused and set-aside the
same. Because to find a man guilty of culpable homicide, the basic fact required to be
established is that the Accused caused the death. But, as noticed above, the medical
evidence is absolutely uncertain regarding the cause of death of Gurnam Singh.
57. The only fact established on evidence is that A-1 gave a single fist blow on the
head of the deceased Gurnam Singh. No weapon was used, nor was there any past
enmity between the Accused and the deceased. It all started with a dispute regarding
the right of way resulting in a brawl between them, a very common sight in this
country.
5 8 . Apparently, some verbal exchange took place between the Accused and the
deceased. It is not clear from the record as to what exactly are the words spoken by
them except a vague indication that some intemperate language was employed by both
of them, nor is it clear who initiated the exchange.
59. In view of our above conclusion, we do not see any reason to discuss the various
submissions made in Criminal Appeal No. 60 of 2007 filed by the de facto complainant.
Their entire case is sought to be built up on the lapses in the investigation process and
the conduct of the Accused in securing the anticipatory bail within few days of the
incident and the decision of the State initially not to prosecute A-1. Various other
factors sought to be relied upon by the de facto complainant pertain to certain
deficiencies in the process of the investigation (such as the non-seizure of the vehicle
by which deceased and PWs 3 and 4 were travelling and the disinclination of the State
to array the first Accused herein as the Accused in the Sessions Case No.
79/18.8.94/20.8.94 either by design or otherwise) make no difference to the conclusion
that the first Accused cannot be held to be responsible for the death of Gurnam Singh in
view of the medical evidence. The de facto complainant also calls upon this Court to
believe that in view of the celebrity status of the first accused, the State went out of its
way to shield his crime. Therefore, the first Accused must be held to have caused the
death of Gurnam Singh.
6 0 . No doubt that there are lapses in the investigation. We cannot hazard a guess
whether such lapses occurred because of the general inefficiency of the system or as a
consequence of a concerted effort made to protect the accused. The law of this country
is not that people are convicted of offences on the basis of doubts.
61. We must also mention here that the de facto complainant moved an I.A. No. 50523
of 2018 praying that the content of a CD be received as additional evidence, along with
the CD allegedly containing some interview given by the first Accused to some TV
channel. The said CD is said to contain certain statements which would go in the
opinion of the de facto complainant to prove the guilt of the accused.
62. For receiving such material on record at this stage, in our opinion, requires the
examination of too many questions of law including questions of the interpretation of
some of the provisions of the Constitution. Assuming for the sake of argument that this
Court in exercise of its extra-ordinary jurisdiction can receive such evidence, necessarily
such an exercise requires the giving of an opportunity to the first Accused before such
evidence is taken on record.
In our opinion, all that is avoidable for the reason: even if it is assumed that the first
Accused admitted to his participation in the occurrence, (a fact which we have already
concluded independent of his own confession alleged in the TV show) in the light of the
medical evidence on record, he cannot be held guilty of causing the death of Gurnam
Singh. We, therefore, see no reason to entertain the application. Such admissions, if
any do not help improve the case of the de facto complainant.
63. The net result of all the above discussion is that the first Accused cannot be held to
be responsible for causing the death of Gurnam Singh. Therefore, the judgment under
appeal is required to be set aside and is accordingly set aside. The material on record
leads us to the only possible conclusion that we can reach that the first Accused
voluntarily caused hurt to Gurnam Singh punishable Under Section 323 Indian Penal
Code.
6 4 . The next question is what would be the appropriate punishment for such an
offence. Section 323 Indian Penal Code stipulates a punishment of imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to one year or with fine which may
extend to Rs. 1000/- or with both. In the circumstances of the case having regard to the
facts that (i) the incident is 30 years old; (ii) there is no past enmity between the
Accused and the deceased; (iii) no weapon was used by the accused; and (iv) the
background in which it happened, we are of the opinion, a punishment of imposition of
fine of Rs. 1000/- would meet the ends of justice in this case.
65. In view of the foregoing, we allow the appeals of the Accused as indicated above
and dismiss the appeal of the complainant.","Appellants: Rupinder Singh Sandhu

Case Category:
CRIMINAL MATTERS - CRIMINAL MATTERS IN WHICH SENTENCE AWARDED IS UPTO
FIVE YEARS
Facts:
The third and fourth Prosecution Witness and the deceased were travelling in
a car. A dispute took place between the first and second Accused and the
deceased. The accused inflicted blows to the deceased and took the key of
their car and flew away. The deceased was taken to the hospital by a
rickshaw, where he was declared dead. The matter was adjudicated wherein
the Trial Court acquitted the Accused. An appeal was preferred. The High
Court reversed the acquittal and convicted first and second Accused under
Sections 34,304 Part II, 323 of IPC. Aggrieved by, present appeal was
preferred.
Held, while allowing the Appeal:
(i) In the impugned judgment of the High Court, there was no discussion
regarding the identity of second Accused or the role played by him in the
incident. Without any discussion whatsoever regarding the evidence either to
prove the presence of second Accused along with first Accused at the time of
the occurrence or the role played by second Accused in the incident insofar as
it pertained to the death of deceased, the High Court chose to record a finding
of guilt against second Accused under Section 304 Part-II read with Section
34 of IPC. It must be remembered that the evidence of third and fourth
Prosecution Witness was recorded some 7 years after the incident. The first
time third Prosecution Witness ever identified the other clean shaven man
accompanying first Accused on the fateful day to be second Accused at the
trial of the Sessions Case. Even by then some 5 years had elapsed from the
date of offence. The High Court abruptly recorded a conclusion that second
Accused was guilty of an offence of Section 304 Part-II read with Section 34
Indian Penal Code. Such a conclusion in view of the present Court was wholly
unsustainable. [31] and[32]
(ii) The statements made and the evidence of first Prosecution Witness that
the head injury itself could be sufficient to cause the death in the ordinary
course of nature was mere ipse dixit. Neither any specific detail regarding the
volume of the subdural hemorrhage was available on record, nor any medical
opinion that the subdural hemorrhage caused the compression of the brain
that caused the death of deceased. There was no evidence of any concomitant
brain injury. The post-mortem report and the evidence of second Prosecution
Witness was silent in this regard. The pathologist's report was clear about the
absence of any pathology in brain. Such being the evidence on record, the
conclusion of the High Court that deceased's death was caused by subdural
hemorrhage but not cardiac arrest, in the opinion of the present Court, was
not based on any evidence on record and was a pure conjecture. The present
Court found it difficult to sustain the conviction of the first Accused and setaside
the same. Because to find a man guilty of culpable homicide, the basic
fact required to be established is that the Accused caused the death. But, as
noticed above, the medical evidence was absolutely uncertain regarding the
cause of death of the deceased. [56]",,,,
"Adarsh Kumar Goel, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. The question which has arisen in this appeal is whether any directions are called for
to prevent the misuse of Section 498A, as acknowledged in certain studies and
decisions. The Court requested Shri A.S. Nadkarni, learned ASG and Shri V.V. Giri,
learned senior Counsel to assist the Court as amicus. We place on record our gratitude
for the assistance rendered by learned ASG Shri Nadkarni and learned senior Counsel
Shri Giri who in turn was ably assisted by advocates Ms. Uttara Babbar, Ms. Pragya
Baghel and Ms. Svadha Shanker.
3 . Proceedings have arisen from complaint dated 2nd December, 2013 filed by
Respondent No. 2 wife of Appellant No. 1. Appellants 2 to 5 are the parents and siblings
of Appellant No. 1. The complainant alleged that she was married to Appellant No. 1 on
28th November, 2012. Her father gave dowry as per his capacity but the Appellants
were not happy with the extent of the dowry. They started abusing the complainant.
They made a demand of dowry of Rs. 3,00,000/- and a car which the family could not
arrange. On 10th November, 2013, Appellant No. 1 dropped the complainant at her
matrimonial home. She was pregnant and suffered pain in the process and her
pregnancy was terminated. On the said version, and further version that her stridhan
was retained, Appellant No. 1 was summoned Under Section 498A and Section 323
Indian Penal Code. Appellants 2 to 5 were not summoned. Order dated 14th July, 2014
read as follows:
After perusal of the file and the document brought on record. It is clear that the
husband Shri Rajesh Sharma demanded car and three lacs rupees and in not
meeting the demand. It appears that he has tortured the complainant. So far as
torture and retaining of the stri dhan and demanding 50,000 and a gold chain
and in not meeting the demand the torture is attributable against Shri Rajesh
Sharma. Rajesh Sharma appears to be main accused. In the circumstances, rest
of the Accused Vijay Sharma, Jaywati Sharma, Praveen Sharma and Priyanka
Sharma have not committed any crime and they have not participated in
commission of the crime. Whereas, it appears that Rajesh Sharma has
committed an offence Under Section 498A, 323 Indian Penal Code and read with
Section 3/4 DP act appears to have prima facie made out. Therefore, a summon
be issued against him.
4 . Against the above order, Respondent No. 2 preferred a revision petition and
submitted that Appellants 2 to 5 should also have been summoned. The said petition
was accepted by the Additional Sessions Judge, Jaunpur vide order dated 3rd July,
2015. The trial court was directed to take a fresh decision in the matter. Thereafter, the
trial court vide order dated 18th August, 2015 summoned Appellants 2 to 5 also. The
Appellants approached the High Court Under Section 482 Code of Criminal Procedure
against the order of summoning. Though the matter was referred to the mediation
centre, the mediation failed. Thereafter, the High Court found no ground to interfere
with the order of summoning and dismissed the petition. Hence this appeal.
5 . Main contention raised in support of this appeal is that there is need to check the
tendency to rope in all family members to settle a matrimonial dispute. Omnibus
allegations against all relatives of the husband cannot be taken at face value when in
normal course it may only be the husband or at best his parents who may be Accused of
demanding dowry or causing cruelty. To check abuse of over implication, clear
supporting material is needed to proceed against other relatives of a husband. It is
stated that Respondent No. 2 herself left the matrimonial home. Appellant No. 2, father
of Appellant No. 1, is a retired government employee. Appellant No. 3 is a house wife.
Appellant No. 4 is unmarried brother and Appellant No. 5 is unmarried sister who is a
government employee. Appellants 2 to 5 had no interest in making any demand of
dowry.
6 . Learned Counsel for Respondent No. 2 supported the impugned order and the
averments in the complaint.
7 . Learned ASG submitted that Section 498A was enacted to check unconscionable
demands by greedy husbands and their families which at times result in cruelty to
women and also suicides. He, however, accepted that there is a growing tendency to
abuse the said provision to rope in all the relatives including parents of advanced age,
minor children, siblings, grand-parents and uncles on the strength of vague and
exaggerated allegations without there being any verifiable evidence of physical or
mental harm or injury. At times, this results in harassment and even arrest of innocent
family members, including women and senior citizens. This may hamper any possible
reconciliation and reunion of a couple. Reference has been made to the statistics from
the Crime Records Bureau (CRB) as follows:
9. That according to Reports of National Crime Record Bureau in 2005, for a
total 58,319 cases reported Under Section 498A Indian Penal Code, a total of
1,27,560 people were arrested, and 6,141 cases were declared false on account
of mistake of fact or law. While in 2009 for a total 89,546 cases reported, a total
of 1,74,395 people were arrested and 8,352 cases were declared false on
account of mistake of fact or law.
10. That according to Report of Crime in India, 2012 Statistics, National Crime
Records Bureau, Ministry of Home Affairs showed that for the year of 2012, a
total of 197,762 people all across India were arrested Under Section 498A,
Indian Penal Code. The Report further shows that approximately a quarter of
those arrested were women that is 47,951 of the total were perhaps mother or
sisters of the husband. However most surprisingly the rate of charge-sheet fling
for the year 2012, Under Section 498A Indian Penal Code was at an exponential
height of 93.6% while the conviction rate was at a staggering low at 14.4%
only. The Report stated that as many as 3,72,706 cases were pending trial of
which 3,17,000 were projected to be acquitted.
11. That according to Report of Crime in India, 2013, the National Crime
Records Bureau further pointed out that of 4,66,079 cases that were pending in
the start of 2013, only 7,258 were convicted while 38,165 were acquitted and
8,218 were withdrawn. The conviction rate of cases registered Under Section
498A Indian Penal Code was also a staggering low at 15.6%.
8 . Referring to Sushil Kumar Sharma v. Union of India MANU/SC/0418/2005 :
(2005) 6 SCC 281, Preeti Gupta v. State of Jharkhand MANU/SC/0592/2010 :
(2010) 7 SCC 667, Ramgopal v. State of Madhya Pradesh MANU/SC/0562/2010 :
(2010) 13 SCC 540, Savitri Devi v. Ramesh Chand ILR (2003) I Delhi 484, it was
submitted that misuse of the provision is judicially acknowledged and there is need to
adopt measures to prevent such misuse. The Madras High Court in M.P. No. 1 of 2008 in
Cr.O.P. No. 1089 of 2008 dated 4 th August, 2008 directed issuance of following
guidelines:
It must also be borne in mind that the object behind the enactment of Section
498-A Indian Penal Code and the Dowry Prohibition Act is to check and curb the
menace of dowry and at the same time, to save the matrimonial homes from
destruction. Our experience shows that, apart from the husband, all family
members are implicated and dragged to the police stations. Though arrest of
those persons is not at all necessary, in a number of cases, such harassment is
made simply to satisfy the ego and anger of the complainant. By suitably dealing
with such matters, the injury to innocents could be avoided to a considerable
extent by the Magistrates, but, if the Magistrates themselves accede to the bare
requests of the police without examining the actual state of affairs, it would
create negative effects thereby, the very purpose of the legislation would be
defeated and the doors of conciliation would be closed forever. The husband
and his family members may have difference of opinion in the dispute, for
which, arrest and judicial remand are not the answers. The ultimate object of
every legal system is to punish the guilty and protect the innocents.
9 . Delhi High Court vide order dated 4th August, 2008 in Chander Bhan v. State
(2008) 151 DLT 691 in Bail Application No. 1627/2008 directed issuance of following
guidelines:
2. Police Authorities:
(a) Pursuant to directions given by the Apex Court, the Commissioner of
Police, Delhi vide Standing Order No. 330/2007 had already issued
guidelines for arrest in the dowry cases registered Under Sections 498-
A/406 Indian Penal Code and the said guidelines should be followed by
the Delhi Police strictly and scrupulously.
(i) No case Under Section 498-A/406 Indian Penal Code should
be registered without the prior approval of DCP/Addl. DCP.
(ii) Arrest of main Accused should be made only after thorough
investigation has been conducted and with the prior approval of
the ACP/DCP.
(iii) Arrest of the collateral Accused such as father-in-law,
mother-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law etc. should only
be made after prior approval of DCP on file.
(b) Police should also depute a well trained and a well behaved
staff in all the crime against women cells especially the lady
officers, all well equipped with the abilities of perseverance,
persuasion, patience and forbearance.
(c) FIR in such cases should not be registered in a routine
manner.
(d) The endeavor of the Police should be to scrutinize
complaints very carefully and then register FIR.
(e) The FIR should be registered only against those persons
against whom there are strong allegations of causing any kind
of physical or mental cruelty as well as breach of trust.
(f) All possible efforts should be made, before recommending
registration of any FIR, for reconciliation and in case it is found
that there is no possibility of settlement, then necessary steps
in the first instance be taken to ensure return of stridhan and
dowry articles etc. by the Accused party to the complainant.
10. I n Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar MANU/SC/0559/2014 : (2014) 8 SCC 273,
this Court directed as follows:
11.1 All the State Governments to instruct its police officers not to automatically
arrest when a case Under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code is registered
but to satisfy themselves about the necessity for arrest under the parameters
laid down above flowing from Section 41, Code of Criminal Procedure;
11.2 All police officers be provided with a check list containing specified subclauses
Under Section 41(1)(b)(ii);
11.3 The police officer shall forward the check list duly filed and furnish the
reasons and materials which necessitated the arrest, while forwarding/producing
the Accused before the Magistrate for further detention;
11.4 The Magistrate while authorizing detention of the Accused shall peruse the
report furnished by the police officer in terms aforesaid and only after recording
its satisfaction, the Magistrate will authorize detention;
11.5 The decision not to arrest an accused, be forwarded to the Magistrate
within two weeks from the date of the institution of the case with a copy to the
Magistrate which may be extended by the Superintendent of police of the district
for the reasons to be recorded in writing;
11.6 Notice of appearance in terms of Section 41A of Code of Criminal
Procedure be served on the Accused within two weeks from the date of
institution of the case, which may be extended by the Superintendent of Police
of the District for the reasons to be recorded in writing;
11.7 Failure to comply with the directions aforesaid shall apart from rendering
the police officers concerned liable for departmental action, they shall also be
liable to be punished for contempt of court to be instituted before High Court
having territorial jurisdiction.
11.8 Authorising detention without recording reasons as aforesaid by the judicial
Magistrate concerned shall be liable for departmental action by the appropriate
High Court.
11. Learned ASG suggested that there must be some preliminary inquiry on the lines of
observations in Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh
MANU/SC/1166/2013 : (2014) 2 SCC 1. Arrest of a relative other than husband could
only be after permission from the concerned Magistrate. There should be no arrest of
relatives aged above 70 years. Power of the police to straight away arrest must be
prohibited. While granting permission, the court must ascertain that there is prima facie
material of the Accused having done some overt and covert act. The offence should be
made compoundable and bailable. The role of each Accused must be specified in the
complaint and the complaint must be accompanied by a signed affidavit. The copy of
the preliminary enquiry report should be furnished to the accused.
12. Shri V. Giri, learned senior Counsel assisted by advocates Ms. Uttara Babbar, Ms.
Pragya Baghel and Ms. Svadha Shanker submitted that arrest in an offence Under
Section 498A should be only after recording reasons and express approval from the
Superintendent of Police. In respect of relatives who are ordinarily residing outside
India, the matter should proceed only if the IO is convinced that arrest is necessary for
fair investigation. In such cases impounding of passport or issuance of red corner notice
should be avoided. Procedure Under Section 14 of the Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act, 2005, of counseling should be made mandatory before
registration of a case Under Section 498A.
13. We have given serious consideration to the rival submissions as well as suggestions
made by learned ASG and Shri V. Giri, Senior Advocate assisted by Advocates Ms.
Uttara Babbar, Ms. Pragya Baghel and Ms. Svadha Shanker. We have also perused 243rd
Law Commission Report (August, 2012), 140th Report of the Rajya Sabha Committee on
Petition (September, 2011) as well as several decisions to which our attention has been
invited.
14. Section 498A was inserted in the statute with the laudable object of punishing
cruelty at the hands of husband or his relatives against a wife particularly when such
cruelty had potential to result in suicide or murder of a woman as mentioned in the
Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act 46 of 1983. The expression 'cruelty' in
Section 498A covers conduct which may drive the women to commit suicide or cause
grave injury (mental or physical) or danger to life or harassment with a view to coerce
her to meet unlawful demand1. It is a matter of serious concern that large number of
cases continue to be filed Under Section 498A alleging harassment of married women.
We have already referred to some of the statistics from the Crime Records Bureau. This
Court had earlier noticed the fact that most of such complaints are filed in the heat of
the moment over trivial issues. Many of such complaints are not bona fide. At the time
of fling of the complaint, implications and consequences are not visualized. At times
such complaints lead to uncalled for harassment not only to the Accused but also to the
complainant. Uncalled for arrest may ruin the chances of settlement.
This Court had earlier observed that a serious review of the provision was warranted2.
The matter also appears to have been considered by the Law Commission, the Malimath
Committee, the Committee on Petitions in the Rajya Sabha, the Home Ministry, which
have been referred to in the earlier part of the Judgment. The abuse of the provision
was also noted in the judgments of this Court referred to earlier. Some High Courts
have issued directions to check such abuse. In Arnesh Kumar (supra) this Court gave
directions to safeguard uncalled for arrests. Recommendation has also been made by
the Law Commission to make the offence compoundable.
15. Following areas appear to require remedial steps:
i) Uncalled for implication of husband and his relatives and arrest.
ii) Continuation of proceedings in spite of settlement between the parties since
the offence is non-compoundable and uncalled for hardship to parties on that
account.
16. Function of this Court is not to legislate but only to interpret the law. No doubt in
doing so laying down of norms is sometimes unavoidable3. Just and fair procedure
being part of fundamental right to life,4 interpretation is required to be placed on a
penal provision so that its working is not unjust, unfair or unreasonable. The court has
incidental power to quash even a non-compoundable case of private nature, if
continuing the proceedings is found to be oppressive5. While stifling a legitimate
prosecution is against public policy, if the proceedings in an offence of private nature
are found to be oppressive, power of quashing is exercised.
17. We have considered the background of the issue and also taken into account the
243rd Report of the Law Commission dated 30th August, 2012, 140th Report of the
Rajya Sabha Committee on Petitions (September, 2011) and earlier decisions of this
Court. We are conscious of the object for which the provision was brought into the
statute. At the same time, violation of human rights of innocent cannot be brushed
aside. Certain safeguards against uncalled for arrest or insensitive investigation have
been addressed by this Court. Still, the problem continues to a great extent.
18. To remedy the situation, we are of the view that involvement of civil society in the
aid of administration of justice can be one of the steps, apart from the investigating
officers and the concerned trial courts being sensitized. It is also necessary to facilitate
closure of proceedings where a genuine settlement has been reached instead of parties
being required to move High Court only for that purpose.
1 9 . Thus, after careful consideration of the whole issue, we consider it fit to give
following directions:
i) (a) In every district one or more Family Welfare Committees be constituted
by the District Legal Services Authorities preferably comprising of three
members. The constitution and working of such committees may be reviewed
from time to time and at least once in a year by the District and Sessions Judge
of the district who is also the Chairman of the District Legal Services Authority.
(b) The Committees may be constituted out of para legal volunteers/social
workers/retired persons/wives of working officers/other citizens who may be
found suitable and willing.
(c) The Committee members will not be called as witnesses.
(d) Every complaint Under Section 498A received by the police or the
Magistrate be referred to and looked into by such committee. Such committee
may have interaction with the parties personally or by means of telephone or
any other mode of communication including electronic communication.
(e) Report of such committee be given to the Authority by whom the complaint
is referred to it latest within one month from the date of receipt of complaint.
(f) The committee may give its brief report about the factual aspects and its
opinion in the matter.
(g) Till report of the committee is received, no arrest should normally be
effected.
(h) The report may be then considered by the Investigating Officer or the
Magistrate on its own merit.
(i) Members of the committee may be given such basic minimum training as
may be considered necessary by the Legal Services Authority from time to time.
(j) The Members of the committee may be given such honorarium as may be
considered viable.
(k) It will be open to the District and Sessions Judge to utilize the cost fund
wherever considered necessary and proper.
ii) Complaints Under Section 498A and other connected offences may be
investigated only by a designated Investigating Officer of the area. Such
designations may be made within one month from today. Such designated
officer may be required to undergo training for such duration (not less than one
week) as may be considered appropriate. The training may be completed within
four months from today;
iii) In cases where a settlement is reached, it will be open to the District and
Sessions Judge or any other senior Judicial Officer nominated by him in the
district to dispose of the proceedings including closing of the criminal case if
dispute primarily relates to matrimonial discord;
iv) If a bail application is filed with at least one clear day's notice to the Public
Prosecutor/complainant, the same may be decided as far as possible on the
same day. Recovery of disputed dowry items may not by itself be a ground for
denial of bail if maintenance or other rights of wife/minor children can
otherwise be protected. Needless to say that in dealing with bail matters,
individual roles, prima facie truth of the allegations, requirement of further
arrest/custody and interest of justice must be carefully weighed;
v) In respect of persons ordinarily residing out of India impounding of
passports or issuance of Red Corner Notice should not be a routine;
vi) It will be open to the District Judge or a designated senior judicial officer
nominated by the District Judge to club all connected cases between the parties
arising out of matrimonial disputes so that a holistic view is taken by the Court
to whom all such cases are entrusted; and
vii) Personal appearance of all family members and particularly outstation
members may not be required and the trial court ought to grant exemption from
personal appearance or permit appearance by video conferencing without
adversely affecting progress of the trial.
viii) These directions will not apply to the offences involving tangible physical
injuries or death.
20. After seeing the working of the above arrangement for six months but latest by
March 31, 2018, National Legal Services Authority may give a report about need for any
change in above directions or for any further directions. The matter may be listed for
consideration by the Court in April, 2018.
21. Copies of this order be sent to National Legal Services Authority, Director General
of Police of all the States and the Registrars of all the High Courts for further
appropriate action.
22. It will be open to the parties in the present case to approach the concerned trial or
other court for further orders in the light of the above directions.","Appellants: Rajesh Sharma and Ors.

proceedings including closing of the criminal case if dispute primarily relates
to matrimonial discord. In respect of persons ordinarily residing out of India
impounding of passports or issuance of Red Corner Notice should not be a
routine. It would be open to the District Judge or a designated senior judicial
officer to club all connected cases between the parties arising out of
matrimonial disputes so that a holistic view could be taken by the Court to
whom all such cases were entrusted. Personal appearance of all family
members and particularly outstation members might not be required and the
Trial Court ought to grant exemption from personal appearance or permit
appearance by video conferencing without adversely affecting progress of the
trial. [19]",,,,
"R. Banumathi, J.
1. These appeals arise out of the judgment dated 05.05.2009 passed by the High Court
of Delhi in Criminal Appeal No. 384 of 2000 in and by which the High Court allowed the
appeal filed by the Respondents/Accused thereby setting aside their conviction Under
Section 376(2)(g) Indian Penal Code passed by the trial court and the sentence of
imprisonment imposed upon them. By the impugned judgment, the High Court also
issued direction to lodge a complaint against the Appellants-police officials (CA No.
2298/2009) for prosecuting them Under Sections 193 and 195 Indian Penal Code.
2 . Case of prosecution is that the Accused/Respondents who were living in the
neighbourhood of the prosecutrix (PW-1) at Shaheed Bhagat Singh Jhuggi Camp,
Katwaria Sarai, entered her jhuggi at about 09.00 PM on 28.07.1997 and demanded a
bidi from her. She refused to give them any bidi. Thereafter, they demanded water
which she again refused. The prosecutrix has alleged that thereafter
Respondents/Accused switched off the electricity and Accused/Respondent No. 2
Gunjesh Chaudhary caught hold of her hands and the other three Accused had torn her
clothes and committed rape on her in turn. The prosecutrix has alleged that she raised
an alarm and fell unconscious thereafter. On hearing the alarm, Bashira Khatoon,
mother of the prosecutrix (PW-3) came there and saw the four Accused/Respondents
coming out of the jhuggi. Bashira Khatoon (PW-3) found the prosecutrix lying
unconscious inside the jhuggi. Police Control Room (PCR) van took the prosecutrix to
All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) hospital. At about 11.45 PM, the
prosecutrix was medically examined by Dr. Monika and it was noted in MLC (Ex.-
PW6/A) that there were ""bruises of 4 x 4 cm on medial aspects of both thighs of the
prosecutrix"". The blouse of the prosecutrix was found torn in the back side along the
left sleeve.
3 . At about 09.30 PM, information was received in the Police Station, Hauz Khaz
PCR/South District regarding some quarrel at Shaheed Bhagat Singh Jhuggi. SI Jai
Bhagwan (PW-7) along with Constable Khushi Ram (PW-4) reached the spot and learnt
that the prosecutrix was taken to the hospital by a PCR Van. SI Jai Bhagawan (PW-7)
along with the constable went to the AIIMS and found PW-1 Phoola (Prosecutrix) there.
Doctor declared PW-1 fit to make statement and SI Jai Bhagwan recorded her statement
concerning allegations of rape by the Accused/Respondents. The statement of the
prosecutrix was recorded at 02.30 AM on 29.07.1997 and ruqqa for registration of the
case Under Section 376 Indian Penal Code was sent at 02.50 AM. A case under FIR No.
559/97 Under Section 376 Indian Penal Code read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code
was registered at 03.15 AM on 29.07.1997.
4 . On the date of incident i.e. 28.07.1997 at about 11.45 PM, the prosecutrix was
medically examined by Dr. Monika. It was noted in the MLC (Ex.-PW6/A) that there
were bruises of 4 cm x 4 cm on the medial aspects of both the thighs of the prosecutrix.
The blouse was torn along the back of the left sleeve and at the time of preparing the
MLC (Ex.-PW6/A); the clothes of prosecutrix could not be sealed since she did not have
spare clothes. Later her petticoat was collected and sent for chemical examination. Upon
completion of investigation, charge sheet was filed against the Accused/Respondents.
5 . Charges were framed against the Accused/Respondents Under Section 376(2)(g)
Indian Penal Code to which they pleaded not guilty. To bring home the guilt of the
Accused, the prosecution examined seven witnesses and exhibited number of
documents. The Accused/Respondents in their statement Under Section 313 Code of
Criminal Procedure stated that PW-1-Prosecutrix was of bad character and she was
indulging in prostitution and they have lodged complaint against her and therefore, they
have been falsely implicated in the rape case.
6 . Upon consideration of evidence of PW-1-Prosecutrix and medical report, forensic
report and other evidence, the trial court convicted Accused/Respondents Under Section
376(2)(g) Indian Penal Code and sentenced each of them to undergo rigorous
imprisonment for ten years. Being aggrieved, the Accused/Respondents filed appeal
before the High Court. In the High Court, the Accused/Respondents filed petition Under
Section 391 Code of Criminal Procedure for taking additional evidence which was
allowed by the High Court. The High Court by the impugned judgment allowed the
appeal by setting aside the conviction of the Accused/Respondents Under Section
376(2)(g) Indian Penal Code. The High Court held that regarding the ladies quarrel at
07.30 p.m. on 28.07.1997 involving sex workers including the prosecutrix at Shaheed
Bhagat Singh Jhuggi, FIR No. 558/97 was registered and in connection with the said FIR
No. 558/97, the prosecutrix and other ladies were arrested and that they were in
custody with the police till at least 09.30 PM. The High Court therefore doubted the
prosecution case in FIR No. 559/97 and held that when the prosecutrix and other ladies
were in custody with the police between 08.50 PM till 10.00 PM on 28.07.1997, it is
quite impossible that the occurrence of rape would have taken place at 09.00 PM on
28.07.1997 as alleged by the prosecutrix.
7 . Based upon the Report of Joint Commissioner (Ex.-DW6/A) and the Report of DCP,
the High court directed the Registrar General of the High Court to make a complaint
against SI Jai Bhagwan (PW-7), SI Prem Chand (DW-3) and Head Constable Sagar
Chand (DW-5) before the concerned court for prosecution for the offences Under
Sections 193 and 195 Indian Penal Code. Being aggrieved by the remarks made against
them and also the direction to lodge a complaint to initiate prosecution against them, SI
Jai Bhagwan (PW-7), SI Prem Chand (DW-3) and Head Constable Sagar Chand (DW-5)
have preferred Criminal Appeal No. 2298 of 2009.
8. The learned Additional Solicitor General Mr. Vikaramjit Banerjee appearing on behalf
of Appellant Govt. of NCT of Delhi has submitted that the High Court has failed to
appreciate the evidence of PW-1-Prosecutrix which is corroborated by the medical
evidence and the High Court erred in relying upon the events in FIR No. 558/97 and
erred in acquitting the Respondents/Accused. The learned Additional Solicitor General
further submitted that the High Court erred in relying upon the report of the Joint
Commissioner (Ex.-DW6/A) and other materials produced at the time of arguments and
the High Court ought not to have proceeded on presumption and conjectures and erred
in not appreciating the evidence and materials placed on record.
9. The learned senior Counsel Mr. Mukul Gupta and Mr. Sanjay R. Hegde appearing for
the Appellants-police have taken us through the evidence and other materials and
submitted that the police officials have correctly investigated the case and without
giving an opportunity of hearing, the High Court was not right in passing disparaging
remarks against the police officials and issuing directions to lodge a complaint against
the Appellants-police officials to initiate the prosecution Under Sections 193 and 195
Indian Penal Code which have very serious consequences and impact on their official
career.
10. Though the Accused initially engaged a lawyer, in later hearings of the appeal, they
were not represented. Mr. Praveen Chaturvedi was nominated as the counsel for the
Respondents through Supreme Court Legal Services Committee who made meticulous
submissions. Contention of the Respondents/Accused is that PW-1-Prosecutrix was in
custody of police between 08.50 PM to 10.00 PM on 28.07.1997 in connection with FIR
No. 558/97 Under Section 160 Indian Penal Code and therefore, the alleged offence of
gang rape (FIR No. 559/97) could not have been committed by the
Respondents/Accused in the manner alleged. It is the contention of the
Respondents/Accused that the police and prosecutrix have conspired a plot of false rape
case implicating the Respondents and the High Court rightly acquitted the
Accused/Respondents and directed to initiate action against the police.
11. We have carefully considered the submissions of the Respondents/Accused and also
the Appellant/police officials and perused the impugned judgment and materials on
record.
12. PW-1-Prosecutrix has spoken about the occurrence of rape committed on her that
Accused/Respondent No. 2-Gunjesh Chaudhary caught hold of her hands and that other
three Accused namely Pankaj Chaudhary, Qasim and Jai Lal Yadav had torn her blouse
and committed rape on her and that she raised alarm and then her mother came there
and the Accused persons ran away. Upon consideration of evidence of the prosecutrix,
the trial court held that there is no reason to disbelieve the statement of prosecutrix
where it is sufficiently corroborated by the statement of Bashira Khatoon, mother of
prosecutrix (PW-3) who saw the Accused leaving the jhuggi and identified two of them
in the court.
13. Evidence of the prosecutrix is corroborated by the MLC (Ex.-PW6/A). Dr. Monika
who examined the prosecutrix noted in MLC (Ex-PW6/A) that ""the blouse of the
prosecutrix was found to be torn along the back of the left sleeve and bruises measuring
4 x 4 cm were found on her both thighs"".
14. Contention of the Respondents is that when the prosecutrix was forcibly held by the
Accused and gang raped, in all probability, the prosecutrix must have sustained external
injuries and absence of external injuries raises serious doubts about the prosecution
version. The submission of the Accused/Respondents that the prosecutrix was not
injured, was belied by the presence of bruises measuring 4 x 4 cm on the medial
aspects of both the thighs. The blouse was torn along the back of left sleeve and such
injuries were possible by use of force. Further, the version of the prosecutrix is
corroborated by MLC(Ex.-PW6/A) and that the injuries found could be possible by use
of force. In any event, absence of external injuries does not tantamount to consent nor
does it discredit the version of prosecutrix.
15. The evidence of the prosecutrix is also corroborated by FSL Report (Ex.-PW7/G)
which shows presence of human semen (Ex. 1) on the petticoat of the prosecutrix. As
per the FSL Report (Ex.-PW7/G), blood was detected on Exhibits 3S1 (gauze cloth
piece having brown stains labelled 'Pankaj') ; 3S2 (gauze cloth piece having brown
stains labelled 'Qasim'); and 3S3 (gauze cloth piece having brown stains labelled 'Jai
Lal'). The result of the biological report reads as under:
The presence of semen status of 'B' group on the petticoat of the prosecutrix which
matches with the blood 'B' group of Accused Jai Lal (3S3) corroborates the version of
the prosecutrix. Of course, the Serology Report on Exhibits 3S1 (gauze cloth piece
having brown stains labelled 'Pankaj'); 3S2 (gauze cloth piece having brown stains
labelled 'Qasim') remained inconclusive; probably due to disintegration of the sample.
Such disintegration of the sample does not dilute the version of the prosecutrix.
1 6 . The FSL Report (Ex.-PW7/G) was discarded by the High Court primarily on the
ground that in MLC (Ex.-PW6/A), it is stated that ""the clothes could not be sealed as
patient does not have extra clothes"" which according to the High Court was inconsistent
with the statement of SI Jai Bhagwan (PW-7) that ""Duty Constable of the hospital
produced before me two sealed parcels containing petticoat and slides which was sent to
the FSL"". It is pertinent to note that the prosecutrix was examined by the doctor at
11.45 PM on 28.07.1997; whereas SI Jai Bhagwan (PW-7) after getting statement from
the doctor as to the fit mental state of prosecutrix has recorded the statement of the
prosecutrix at 02.30 AM on 29.07.1997. In her evidence during cross-examination, the
prosecutrix has stated that the petticoat that she was wearing at the time of incident
was seized by the police. Having regard to the evidence of the prosecutrix, we find no
inconsistency between MLC (Ex.-PW6/A) and the statement of SI Jai Bhagwan (PW-7).
1 7 . Drawing our attention to the evidence of prosecutrix who submitted that the
prosecutrix regained consciousness only at 10.00 AM on 29.07.1997 and while so SI Jai
Bhagwan could not have recorded her statement at around 02.30 AM on 29.07.1997 as
stated by him and this again throws serious doubt about the prosecution case. The
prosecutrix (PW-1) was examined in the court on 05.11.1999 nearly two years after the
occurrence and she might not have been able to recollect the happenings as it is. It is
also pertinent to note that SI Jai Bhagwan (PW-7) has enquired the Doctor and the
Doctor has declared that prosecutrix was fit to make the statement and only thereafter
the statement of prosecutrix (PW-1) was recorded (Ex.-PW1/A). In the light of the
evidence of SI Jai Bhagwan that the Doctor declared the prosecutrix fit to make the
statement, there is no merit in the contention of the Accused raising doubts about the
recording of statement of the prosecutrix at 02.30 AM on 29.07.1997.
18. On the next day i.e., on 29-07-1997 all the Accused/Respondents were arrested by
SI Jai Bhagwan (PW-7) and they were medically examined in the hospital between
11.36 AM to 11.38 AM and the doctor opined that ""on clinical examination, there is
nothing to suggest that the said Accused persons are incapable of performing sexual
intercourse"". The blood samples and the slide of smear of the Accused were also seized
and the case property was deposited in the malkhana from where it was sent to FSL. As
pointed out earlier, the FSL Report (Ex.-PW7/G) showed that the semen stains were
found on the petticoat of the prosecutrix (B group) which matched with the blood group
of the Accused/Respondent No. 4-Jai Lal Yadav.
19. It is also relevant to refer to the false explanation of the Accused in their statement
Under Section 313 Code of Criminal Procedure Though the Accused have admitted about
their medical examination, in their statement Under Section 313 Code of Criminal
Procedure all the Accused have given a false version regarding the manner and time of
arrest as after 04.00 PM on 29.07.1997. The statement of the Accused that they were
arrested only after 04.00 PM on 29.07.1997 is not consistent with the materials placed
on record that they were medically examined between 11.36 AM to 11.38 AM on
29.07.1997. The false explanation by the Accused is yet another militating circumstance
against them.
20. Further, as pointed out by the trial court, the prosecutrix had no motive to falsely
implicate the Accused. In their statement Under Section 313 Code of Criminal
Procedure, the Respondents/Accused have stated that the prosecutrix was of bad
character and she was indulging in prostitution regarding which they have lodged
complaint against her and they have been falsely implicated in the case. As pointed out
by the trial court, nothing was brought on record by the Accused to show that they have
lodged complaint against the prosecutrix. Mahanand Jha (DW-1) stated that he is the
President of the jhuggi area. He further stated that about 7-8 women including the
prosecutrix have been indulging in prostitution regarding which he has lodged the
complaint. There is nothing on record to suggest that the Accused were in any way
involved in making such complaints against the prosecutrix and other women. The
version that they lodged complaint against the prosecutrix and therefore, they have
been falsely implicated in the case, is not substantiated by any record.
21. The High Court observed that the trial court erred in saying that the Accused failed
to prove the making of previous complaints against the prosecutrix. While saying so,
the High Court referred to certain complaints made against the prosecutrix including the
one allegedly given on 21.07.1997 which were produced by the Bar at the time of
arguments. The power conferred Under Section 391 Code of Criminal Procedure is to be
exercised with great care and caution. In dealing with any appeal, the appellate court
can refer to the additional evidence only if the same has been recorded as provided
Under Section 391 Code of Criminal Procedure Any material produced before the
appellate court to fill-up the gaps by either side cannot be considered by the appellate
court; more so, to reverse the judgment of the trial court. As rightly contended by the
learned Additional Solicitor General, the High Court has taken into consideration the
materials produced by the Bar, namely, complaints allegedly made against the
prosecutrix and other women including the one allegedly given on 21.07.1997 just one
week prior to the incident. The High Court was not right in taking into consideration
those complaints produced at the time of arguments in the appeal.
22. As rightly held by the trial court that even if the allegations of the Accused that the
prosecutrix is of immoral character are taken to be correct, the same does not give any
right to the Accused persons to commit rape on her against her consent. In State of
Maharashtra and Anr. v. Madhurkar Narayan Mardikar MANU/SC/0032/1991 :
(1991) 1 SCC 57, it was held that even a woman of easy virtue is entitled to privacy and
it is not open to any person to violate her and she is equally entitled to protection of
law. Further, the evidence of such a woman cannot be thrown overboard merely
because she is a woman of easy virtue.
23. Even in cases where there is some material to show that the victim was habituated
to sexual intercourse, no inference like the victim being a woman of 'loose moral
character"" is permissible to be drawn from that circumstance alone. A woman of easy
virtue also could not be raped by a person for that reason. In State of Punjab v.
Gurmeet Singh and Ors. MANU/SC/0366/1996 : (1996) 2 SCC 384, it was held as
under:
16. ...Even if the prosecutrix, in a given case, has been promiscuous in her
sexual behaviour earlier, she has a right to refuse to submit herself to sexual
intercourse to anyone and everyone because she is not a vulnerable object or
prey for being sexually assaulted by anyone and everyone....
While so, the High Court erred in placing reliance upon the complaints allegedly made
against the prosecutrix to doubt her version and to hold that a false case has been
foisted against the Accused.
24. It is now well-settled principle of law that conviction can be sustained on the sole
testimony of the prosecutrix if it inspires confidence.
[Vishnu alias Undrya v. State of Maharashtra MANU/SC/2156/2005 : (2006) 1 SCC
283]. It is well-settled by a catena of decisions of this Court that there is no Rule of law
or practice that the evidence of the prosecutrix cannot be relied upon without
corroboration and as such it has been laid down that corroboration is not a sine qua
non for conviction in a rape case. If the evidence of the victim does not suffer from any
basic infirmity and the 'probabilities factor' does not render it unworthy of credence, as
a general rule, there is no reason to insist on corroboration except from medical
evidence, where, having regard to the circumstances of the case, medical evidence can
be expected to be forthcoming. [State v. N.K. The Accused MANU/SC/0218/2000 :
(2000) 5 SCC 30].
25. The trial court which had the opportunity of seeing and observing the prosecutrix,
found the testimony of the prosecutrix reliable being corroborated by her mother's
evidence, medical evidence, FSL report and other circumstances viz. absence of motive
for any false implication etc. While so, the High Court ought not to have heavily
interfered with the verdict of conviction based on the alleged time gap in the
registration of two FIRs and other aspects of investigation in connection with FIR No.
558/97 to reverse the verdict of conviction.
2 6 . The High Court reversed the verdict of conviction mainly on the ground of
difference of timing in the registration of FIR No. 558/97 and other aspects of
investigation. At about 08.05 PM, a telephonic information was received vide DD No.
67-B at Police Station Hauz Khas regarding a quarrel at Shaheed Bhagat Singh Jhuggi.
The specific case of the defence is that the prosecutrix was in police custody in FIR No.
558/97 Under Section 160 Indian Penal Code till about 10.00 PM. As per the deposition
of SI Prem Chand (DW-3), he reached the spot with one lady constable Ms. Sarla Toppo
and Constable Sagar Chandra (DW-5) at around 08:18 PM and found the ladies
including prosecutrix quarrelling at public place in their jhuggis and immediately
arrested the ladies and conducted investigation and sent the ruqqa with a constable to
register the FIR Under Section 160 Indian Penal Code. On receipt of information, FIR
No. 558/97 at Police Station Hauz Khas was registered at 09.20 PM on 28.07.1997. SI
Prem Chand (DW-3) stated about the arrest and search of four women and then
released them on bail bonds and he was on the spot up to 08:50 PM.
27. The High Court relied on the statement of Head Constable Ratan Lal (DW-4) that SI
Prem Chand (DW-3) has made a telephonic call at 08:52 PM to know the serial number
of the case and because the FIR was registered at 09:20 PM, the High Court came to the
conclusion that the women involved in the FIR No. 558/97 could not have been released
before 09:20 PM because one of the bail bonds contain the said FIR number and also
held that it is highly unlikely for the police to have completed all the steps referred to
above in respect of each of the four women and released them by 08:52 PM and as per
the site plan drawn in FIR No. 559/97, the distance between the road and jhuggi is such
that it was impossible for the prosecutrix to come back alone and be in her jhuggi at
09.00 PM.
28. The occurrence of rape (FIR No. 559/97) was at about 09.00 PM regarding which
information was received by the same Police Station Hauz Khas at about 09.30 PM. SI
Jai Bhagwan (PW-7) along with constable Khushi Ram (PW-4) reached the spot and
learnt that the prosecutrix was taken to hospital by PCR Van. Thereafter, SI Jai Bhagwan
(PW-7) along with constable Khushi Ram (PW-4) went to AIIMS and found the
prosecutrix there and he recorded her statement at 02.30 AM on 29.07.1997 after
getting the certificate from the doctor. Ruqqa for registration of the case Under Section
376 Indian Penal Code was sent at 02.50 AM and case under FIR No. 559/97 Under
Section 376 Indian Penal Code read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code was registered at
03.15 AM on 29.07.1997.
2 9 . After referring to the timings of FIR No. 558/97, the High Court held that the
quarrelling ladies including the prosecutrix were in custody of the police at least till
08.50 PM and it was highly improbable that the prosecutrix could have come back and
was alone in her jhuggi at 09.00 PM on 28.07.1997 and that the Respondents/Accused
entered her jhuggi and committed rape as alleged by her and that even before 09.30
PM, she was picked up from there by PCR Van. The High Court therefore concluded that
SI Jai Bhagwan, constable Khushi Ram (PW-4) and the prosecutrix (PW-1) have
fabricated false case against the Accused. In this regard, the High Court relied upon the
Report of Joint Commissioner dated 07.11.2000 (Ex.-DW6/A) and the Report of S.K.
Gautam, DCP.
30. The reasoning of the High Court that the ladies were arrested in connection with
FIR No. 558/97 Under Section 160 Indian Penal Code and that the ladies must have
remained with the custody of police till 09.20 PM proceeds on presumptive footing and
surmises. In his evidence, Mahanand Jha (DW-1) has stated that ""the said ladies came
back to the area at 08.30 PM and started abusing the neighbourers"". Likewise,
Sharabuddin (DW-2) has stated that ""the police released the said ladies including Phoola
(PW-1) and after coming back to her jhuggi, she started abusing the neighbours. Then, I
informed PCR Van on telephone and PCR Van came and took Phoola........"". The High
Court failed to appreciate the testimonies of DWs 1 and 2 who have categorically stated
that the prosecutrix had come back and was abusing neighbours. The evidence of DWs
1 and 2 clearly shows that the prosecutrix was let out by the police at or about 08.20
PM on 28.07.1997. Mere fact that FIR No. 558/97 Under Section 160 Indian Penal Code
was registered at 09.20 PM does not indicate that the prosecutrix and other quarrelling
ladies were in the police custody till 09.30 PM on 28.07.1997 (with respect to the
offence in FIR No. 558/97).
31. There were two sets of persons and two sets of officers are involved in FIR No.
558/97 and FIR No. 559/97. The aspect regarding FIR No. 558/97 was not put to the
witnesses even before the trial court. Everything was brought about in appeal as
additional evidence in exercise of the power of the appellate court Under Section 391
Code of Criminal Procedure Placing of heavy reliance by the High Court upon the
contents in FIR No. 558/97 was not a correct approach.
3 2 . Unfortunately, the High Court was swayed by the Departmental Enquiry Report
(Ext.-DW6/A) prepared by Joint Commissioner of Police that was brought on record by
Constable Dharamvir Singh (DW-6). Going through the entire report, we observe that
the departmental enquiry was primarily based on the diary entries and the statements of
one complainant Amod Shastri and statement of ASI Kamal Dev. In the report, Joint
Commissioner of Police, inter-alia concluded that the rape incident could not have
happened at 09.00 PM while SI Prem Chand (DW-3) indicated that quarrelling ladies
including the prosecutrix were released at 08.50 PM. It is pertinent to note that neither
S.K. Gautam, Deputy Commissioner of Police was examined nor the said complainant
Amod Shastri and ASI Kamal Dev were examined. Yet the High Court relied on it to
come to a conclusion that the rape incident could not have happened at the alleged time
and manner.
33. ASI Kamal Dev who took the prosecutrix to the hospital in PCR Van is said to have
made the statement before the Deputy Commissioner of Police stating that when he
questioned the prosecutrix, she was conscious and that she told him that she had been
beaten up and has not stated anything about the alleged incident of rape. In our view,
the High Court was not right in placing heavy reliance upon the report of the Joint
Commissioner and the report of Deputy Commissioner who were not examined before
the court.
34. Based upon the report of Joint Commissioner of Police (Ex.-DW6/A) and the report
of S.K. Gautam, DCP, the High Court made disparaging remarks against the police
officials and directed prosecution against the police Under Sections 193 and 195 Indian
Penal Code. The police officials were neither party nor summoned by the High Court
before making such disparaging remarks and giving directions against them in the
appeal against the conviction. On behalf of the police officials, it is submitted that the
conclusions drawn by the High Court are based on mere surmises and presumptions.
The High Court further relied on the Departmental Enquiry Report (Ex.-DW6/A) which
was not put to test and the maker of the report was not examined which therefore has
no evidentiary value in the eyes of law.
3 5 . While passing disparaging remarks against the police officials and directing
prosecution against them, in our considered view, the High Court has failed to bear in
mind the well settled principles of law that should govern the courts before making
disparaging remarks. Any disparaging remarks and direction to initiate departmental
action/prosecution against the persons whose conduct comes into consideration before
the court would have serious impact on their official career. In S.K. Viswambaran v.
E. Koyakunju and Ors. MANU/SC/0276/1987 : (1987) 2 SCC 109, this Court held as
under:
9. Stung by the remarks made against him without even a hearing....
13. We have also to point out a grievous procedural error committed by the
High Court. Even assuming for argument's sake that for expunging the remarks
against Respondents 2 and 3 the conduct of the Appellant required scrutiny and
merited adverse comment, the principles of natural justice required the High
Court to have issued notice to the Appellant and heard him before passing
adverse remarks against him if it was considered necessary. By its failure the
High Court has failed to render elementary justice to the Appellant.
14. ... In State of U.P. v. Mohd. Naim MANU/SC/0062/1963 : AIR 1964 SC 703,
it was held as follows:
If there is one principle of cardinal importance in the administration of
justice, it is this: the proper freedom and independence of Judges and
Magistrates must be maintained and they must be allowed to perform
their functions freely and fearlessly and without undue interference by
anybody, even by this Court. At the same time, it is equally necessary
that in expressing their opinions Judges and Magistrates must be
guided by considerations of justice, fair play and restraint. It is not
infrequent that sweeping generalisations defeat the very purpose for
which they are made. It has been judicially recognised that in the
matter of making disparaging remarks against persons or authorities
whose conduct comes into consideration before courts of law in cases
to be decided by them, it is relevant to consider (a) whether the party
whose conduct is in question is before the court or has an opportunity
of explaining or defending himself; (b) whether there is evidence on
record bearing on that conduct justifying the remarks; and (c) whether
it is necessary for the decision of the case, as an integral part thereof,
to animadvert on that conduct. It has also been recognised that judicial
pronouncements must be judicial in nature, and should not normally
depart from sobriety, moderation and reserve.
This ratio has been followed in R.K. Lakshmanan v. A.K. Srinivasan and Anr.
MANU/SC/0186/1975 : (1975) 2 SCC 466 andN iranjan Patnaik v. Sashibhusan
Kar and Anr. MANU/SC/0193/1986 : (1986) 2 SCC 569 (to which one of us was
a party). Judged in the light of the above tests, it may be seen that none of the
tests is satisfied in this case. It is indeed regrettable that the High Court should
have lightly passed adverse remarks of a very serious nature affecting the
character and professional competence and integrity of the Appellant in
purported desire to render justice to Respondents 2 and 3 in the petition filed
by them for expunction of adverse remarks made against them.
36. In Manish Dixit and Ors. v. State of Rajasthan MANU/SC/0655/2000 : (2001)
1 SCC 596, this Court held as under:
42. ...Such disparaging remarks and the direction to initiate departmental
action against him could have a very serious impact on his official career.
43. Even those apart, this Court has repeatedly cautioned that before any
castigating remarks are made by the court against any person, particularly
when such remarks could ensure serious consequences on the future career of
the person concerned, he should have been given an opportunity of being heard
in the matter in respect of the proposed remarks or strictures. Such an
opportunity is the basic requirement, for, otherwise the offending remarks
would be in violation of the principles of natural justice. In this case such an
opportunity was not given to PW 30 (Devendra Kumar Sharma). (State of U.P.
v . Mohd. Naim MANU/SC/0062/1963 : AIR 1964 SC 703,C h. Jage Ram,
Inspector of Police and Anr. v. Hans Raj Midha MANU/SC/0081/1971 : (1972) 1
SCC 181, R.K. Lakshmanan v. A.K. Srinivasan and Anr. MANU/SC/0186/1975 :
(1975) 2 SCC 466, Niranjan Patnaik v. Sashibhusan Kar and Anr.
MANU/SC/0193/1986 : (1986) 2 SCC 569 andS tate of Karnataka v. Registrar
General, High Court of Karnataka MANU/SC/0496/2000 : (2000) 7 SCC 333).
Since the High Court has passed strictures against the police officials who were involved
in the investigation in FIR No. 559/1997 without affording an opportunity of hearing to
them, the disparaging remarks are liable to be set aside.
37. Insofar as the direction to initiate the prosecution Under Sections 193, 195 and 211
Indian Penal Code is concerned, Section 340 Code of Criminal Procedure provides the
procedure for offences enumerated in Section 195(1) (b) Code of Criminal Procedure
The object of Section 340 Code of Criminal Procedure is to ascertain whether any
offence affecting administration of justice has been committed in relation to any
document produced or evidence given in court during the time when the document or
evidence was in custodian legis and whether it is also expedient in the interest of justice
to take such action as required Under Section 340 Code of Criminal Procedure.
38. Before directing the prosecution to be initiated Under Section 195 Code of Criminal
Procedure, the court has to follow the procedure Under Section 340 Code of Criminal
Procedure and record a finding that ""it is expedient in the interest of justice........"".
Though wide discretion is given to court Under Section 340 Code of Criminal Procedure,
the same has to be exercised with care and caution. To initiate prosecution Under
Section 195 Code of Criminal Procedure too readily that too against the police officials
who were conducting the investigation may not be a correct approach. Contention of the
learned Counsel for the police officials is that before passing the direction to initiate the
prosecution for the offences Under Sections 193, 195 and 211 Indian Penal Code, the
High Court ought to have followed the procedure contemplated Under Section 340(1)
Code of Criminal Procedure.
39. Section 340(1) Code of Criminal Procedure reads as under:
340. Procedure in cases mentioned in Section 195 - (1) When, upon an
application made to it in this behalf or otherwise, any Court is of opinion that it
is expedient in the interests of justice that an inquiry should be made into any
offence referred to in Clause (b) of Sub-section (1) of Section 195, which
appears to have been committed in or in relation to a proceeding in that Court
or, as the case may be, in respect of a document produced or given in evidence
in a proceeding in that Court, such Court may, after such preliminary inquiry, if
any, as it thinks necessary-
(a) record a finding to that effect;
(b) make a complaint thereof in writing;
(c) send it to a Magistrate of the first class having jurisdiction;
(d) take sufficient security for the appearance of the Accused before
such Magistrate, or if the alleged offence is non-bailable and the Court
thinks it necessary so to do, send the Accused in custody to such
Magistrate; and
(e) bind over any person to appear and give evidence before such
Magistrate.
There are two preconditions for initiating proceedings Under Section 340 Code of
Criminal Procedure:
(i) materials produced before the court must make out a prima-facie case for a
complaint for the purpose of inquiry into an offence referred to in Clause (b)(i)
of Sub-section (1) of Section 195 Code of Criminal Procedure and
(ii) it is expedient in the interests of justice that an inquiry should be made into
4 0 . Observing that the court has to be satisfied as to the prima-facie case for a
complaint for the purpose of inquiry into an offence Under Section 195(1)(b) Code of
Criminal Procedure, this Court in Amarsang Nathaji as himself and as karta and
manager v. Hardik Harshadbhai Patel and Ors. MANU/SC/1516/2016 : (2017) 1
SCC 113 held as under:
6. The mere fact that a person has made a contradictory statement in a judicial
proceeding is not by itself always sufficient to justify a prosecution Under
Sections 199 and 200 of the Penal Code, 1860 (45 of 1860) (hereinafter
referred to as ""IPC""); but it must be shown that the Defendant has intentionally
given a false statement at any stage of the judicial proceedings or fabricated
false evidence for the purpose of using the same at any stage of the judicial
proceedings. Even after the above position has emerged also, still the court has
to form an opinion that it is expedient in the interests of justice to initiate an
inquiry into the offences of false evidence and offences against public justice
and more specifically referred to in Section 340(1) Code of Criminal Procedure,
having regard to the overall factual matrix as well as the probable
consequences of such a prosecution. (See K.T.M.S. Mohd. and Anr. v. Union of
India MANU/SC/0349/1992 : (1992) 3 SCC 178). The court must be satisfied
that such an inquiry is required in the interests of justice and appropriate in the
facts of the case.
7. In the process of formation of opinion by the court that it is expedient in the
interests of justice that an inquiry should be made into, the requirement should
only be to have a prima facie satisfaction of the offence which appears to have
been committed. It is open to the court to hold a preliminary inquiry though it
is not mandatory. In case, the court is otherwise in a position to form such an
opinion, that it appears to the court that an offence as referred to Under Section
340 Code of Criminal Procedure has been committed, the court may dispense
with the preliminary inquiry. Even after forming an opinion as to the offence
which appears to have been committed also, it is not mandatory that a
complaint should be filed as a matter of course. (See Pritish v. State of
Maharashtra and Ors. MANU/SC/0740/2001 : (2002) 1 SCC 253)
8. In Iqbal Singh Marwah and Anr. v. Meenakshi Marwah and Anr.
MANU/SC/0197/2005 : (2005) 4 SCC 370, a Constitution Bench of this Court
has gone into the scope of Section 340 Code of Criminal Procedure Para 23
deals with the relevant consideration:
2 3 . In view of the language used in Section 340 Code of Criminal
Procedure the court is not bound to make a complaint regarding
commission of an offence referred to in Section 195(1) (b), as the
Section is conditioned by the words ""court is of opinion that it is
expedient in the interests of justice"". This shows that such a course will
be adopted only if the interest of justice requires and not in every case.
Before filing of the complaint, the court may hold a preliminary enquiry
and record a finding to the effect that it is expedient in the interests of
justice that enquiry should be made into any of the offences referred to
in Section 195(1)(b). This expediency will normally be judged by the
court by weighing not the magnitude of injury suffered by the person
affected by such forgery or forged document, but having regard to the
effect or impact, such commission of offence has upon administration
of justice. It is possible that such forged document or forgery may
cause a very serious or substantial injury to a person in the sense that
it may deprive him of a very valuable property or status or the like, but
such document may be just a piece of evidence produced or given in
evidence in court, where voluminous evidence may have been adduced
and the effect of such piece of evidence on the broad concept of
administration of justice may be minimal. In such circumstances, the
court may not consider it expedient in the interest of justice to make a
complaint.
The same principle was reiterated in Chintamani Malviya v. High Court of Madhya
Pradesh MANU/SC/0469/2018 : (2018) 6 SCC 151.
4 1 . It has been consistently held by this Court that prosecution for perjury be
sanctioned by the courts only in those cases where perjury appears to be deliberate and
that prosecution ought to be ordered where it would be expedient in the interest of
justice to punish the delinquent and not merely because there is some inaccuracy in the
statement. In Chajoo Ram v. Radhey Shyam and Anr. MANU/SC/0082/1971 :
(1971) 1 SCC 774, this Court held as under:
7 . The prosecution for perjury should be sanctioned by courts only in those
cases where the perjury appears to be deliberate and conscious and the
conviction is reasonably probable or likely. No doubt giving of false evidence
and filing false affidavits is an evil which must be effectively curbed with a
strong hand but to start prosecution for perjury too readily and too frequently
without due care and caution and on inconclusive and doubtful material defeats
its very purpose. Prosecution should be ordered when it is considered expedient
in the interests of justice to punish the delinquent and not merely because there
is some inaccuracy in the statement which may be innocent or immaterial.
There must be prima facie case of deliberate falsehood on a matter of substance
and the court should be satisfied that there is reasonable foundation for the
charge. In the present case we do not think the material brought to our notice
was sufficiently adequate to justify the conclusion that it is expedient in the
interests of justice to file a complaint. The approach of the High Court seems
somewhat mechanical and superficial: it does not reflect the requisite judicial
deliberation....
42. By perusal of the impugned judgment of the High Court, we find that the High Court
has not recorded a finding that ""it is expedient in the interest of justice to initiate an
inquiry into the offences punishable Under Sections 193 and 195 Indian Penal Code
against the police officials and Under Section 211 Indian Penal Code against the
prosecutrix"". Without affording an opportunity of hearing to the police officials and
based on the materials produced before the appellate court, the High Court, in our view,
was not right in issuing direction to the Registrar General to lodge a complaint against
the police officials and the said direction is liable to be set aside.
4 3 . The High Court erred in brushing aside the evidence of the prosecutrix by
substituting its views on the basis of submissions made on the sequence of events in
FIR No. 558/97 and the report of the Joint Commissioner of Police (Ex.-DW6/A) and the
report of the Deputy Commissioner of Police. The High Court erred in taking into
consideration the materials produced before the appellate court viz., the alleged
complaints made against the prosecutrix and other women alleging that they were
engaged in prostitution. Even assuming that the prosecutrix was of easy virtue, she has
a right of refuse to submit herself to sexual intercourse to anyone. The judgment of the
High Court reversing the verdict of conviction Under Section 376(2)(g) recorded by the
trial court cannot be sustained and is liable to be set aside.
44. For the conviction Under Section 376(2)(g) Indian Penal Code, the Accused shall be
punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years,
but which may be extended to imprisonment for life. After the amendment by Act 13 of
2013 (with retrospective effect from 03.02.2013), the minimum sentence of ten years
was increased to twenty years as per Section 376-D and in the case of conviction, the
court has no discretion but to impose the sentence of minimum twenty years. However,
prior to amendment, proviso to Section 376(2) Indian Penal Code provided a discretion
to the court that ""the court may, for adequate and special reasons to be mentioned in
the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than ten years.""
Though the court is vested with the discretion, in the facts and circumstances of the
case, we are not inclined to exercise our discretion in reducing the sentence of
imprisonment of ten years imposed upon the Respondents-Accused.
45. In the result, the impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside and the appeal
preferred by the State is allowed. The verdict of conviction of Accused-Respondent Nos.
1 to 4 (CA No. 2299/2009) Under Section 376(2)(g) Indian Penal Code and also the
sentence of imprisonment of ten years imposed upon them is affirmed. The
Respondents-Accused Nos. 1 to 4 shall surrender themselves within a period of four
weeks from today to serve the remaining sentence, failing which they shall be taken
into custody. We place on record the valuable assistance rendered by the counsel Mr.
Praveen Chaturvedi who has been nominated by the Supreme Court Legal Services
Committee to argue on behalf of the Respondents/Accused.
4 6 . The direction of the High Court to lodge complaint against the police officials
(Appellants in Criminal Appeal No. 2298 of 2009) is set aside and the appeal preferred
by them is allowed.

Case Category:
CRIMINAL MATTERS - MATTERS FILED BY STATE AGAINST ACQUITTAL
Facts:
Charges were framed against Accused/Respondents under Section 376(2)(g)
o f IPC to which they pleaded not guilty. To bring home guilt of Accused,
prosecution examined seven witnesses and exhibited number of documents.
Accused/Respondents in their statement under Section 313 of Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC) stated that PW-1-Prosecutrix was of bad
character and she was indulging in prostitution and they have lodged
complaint against her and therefore, they had been falsely implicated in rape
case. Trial court convicted Accused/Respondents under Section 376(2)(g) of
IPC and sentenced each of them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten
years. Being aggrieved, Accused/Respondents filed appeal before High Court.
High Court by impugned judgment allowed appeal by setting aside conviction.
High Court held that, regarding the ladies quarrel involving sex workers
including prosecutrix FIR was registered and in connection with said FIR,
prosecutrix and other ladies were arrested and that they were in custody with
police. High Court therefore doubted prosecution case and held that when
prosecutrix and other ladies were in custody with police during relevant time,
it was impossible that, occurrence of rape would have taken place as alleged
by prosecutrix.
Held, while allowing the appeal
As rightly held by trial Court that even if allegations of Accused that,
prosecutrix was of immoral character were taken to be correct, same did not
give any right to Accused persons to commit rape on her against her consent.
[22]
Even in cases where there was some material to show that, victim was
habituated to sexual intercourse, no inference like victim being a woman of
'loose moral character"" iwa permissible to be drawn from that circumstance
alone. A woman of easy virtue also could not be raped by a person for that
reason. [23]
Conviction could be sustained on sole testimony of prosecutrix if it inspired
confidence. [24]
Trial Court which had opportunity of seeing and observing prosecutrix, found
testimony of prosecutrix reliable being corroborated by her mother's evidence,
medical evidence, FSL report and other circumstances viz. absence of motive
for any false implication etc. While so, High Court ought not to have heavily
interfered with verdict of conviction based on alleged time gap in registration
of two FIRs and other aspects of investigation in connection with FIR No.
558/97 to reverse verdict of conviction. [25]
While passing disparaging remarks against police officials and directing
prosecution against them, High Court had failed to bear in mind well settled
principles of law that should govern Courts before making disparaging
remarks. Any disparaging remarks and direction to initiate departmental
action/prosecution against persons whose conduct comes into consideration
before Court would have serious impact on their official career. [35]
It had been consistently held by present Court that, prosecution for perjury be
sanctioned by Courts only in those cases where perjury appears to be
deliberate and that prosecution ought to be ordered where it would be
expedient in interest of justice to punish the delinquent and not merely
because there was some inaccuracy in statement. [41]
High Court had not recorded a finding that ""it was expedient in interest of
justice to initiate an inquiry into offences punishable under Sections 193 and
195 of IPC against police officials and under Section 211 of IPC against the
prosecutrix"". Without affording an opportunity of hearing to police officials
and based on materials produced before appellate Court, High Court was not
right in issuing direction to Registrar General to lodge a complaint against
police officials and said direction was liable to be set aside. [42]
Even assuming that, prosecutrix was of easy virtue, she had a right of refuse
to submit herself to sexual intercourse to anyone. Judgment of High Court
reversing verdict of conviction under Section 376(2)(g) recorded by trial Court
could not be sustained and is liable to be set aside. [43]
Impugned judgment of High Court was set aside and appeal preferred by
State was allowed. Verdict of conviction of Accused-Respondent under Section
376(2)(g) of IPC and also the sentence of imprisonment of ten years imposed
upon them was affirmed. [45]
Direction of High Court to lodge complaint against police officials was set
aside. Appeal allowed. [46]",,,,
"SLP (Crl.) No. 2302 of 2017:
1 . One of the questions which arose in the course of consideration of the matter was
whether videography of the scene of crime or scene of recovery during investigation
should be necessary to inspire confidence in the evidence collected.
2. In Order dated 25th April, 2017 statement of Mr. A.N.S. Nadkarni, learned Additional
Solicitor General is recorded to the effect that videography will help the investigation
and was being successfully used in other countries. He referred to the perceived
benefits of ""Body-Worn Cameras"" in the United States of America and the United
Kingdom. Body-worn cameras act as deterrent against anti-social behaviour and is also
a tool to collect the evidence. It was submitted that new technological device for
collection of evidence are order of the day. He also referred to the Field Officers'
Handbook by the Narcotics Control Bureau, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of
India. Reference was also made to Section 54-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure
providing for videography of the identification process and proviso to Section 164(1)
Code of Criminal Procedure providing for audio video recording of confession or
statement under the said provision.
3. Thereafter, it was noted in the Order dated 12th October, 2017, that the matter was
discussed by the Union Home Secretary with the Chief Secretaries of the States in which
a decision was taken to constitute a Committee of Experts (COE) to facilitate and
prepare a road-map for use of videography in the crime scene and to propose a
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). However, an apprehension was expressed about
its implementation on account of scarcity of funds, issues of securing and storage of
data and admissibility of evidence. We noted the suggestion that still-photography may
be useful on account of higher resolution for forensic analysis. Digital cameras can be
placed on a mount on a tripod which may enable rotation and tilting. Secured portals
may be established by which the Investigation Officer can e-mail photograph(s) taken at
the crime scene. Digital Images can be retained on State's server as permanent record.
SLP(Crl.) No. 9431 of 2011:
4. Since identical question arose for consideration in this special leave petition as noted
in Order dated 12th October, 2017, we have heard learned amicus, Mr. Jayant Bhushan,
senior advocate, Ms. Meenakshi Arora, senior advocate, assisted by Ms. Ananya Ghosh,
Advocate, on the question of admissibility of electronic record. We have also heard Mr.
Yashank Adhyaru, learned senior Counsel, and Ms. Shirin Khajuria, learned Counsel,
appearing for Union of India.
5. An apprehension was expressed on the question of applicability of conditions Under
Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act to the effect that if a statement was given in
evidence, a certificate was required in terms of the said provision from a person
occupying a responsible position in relation to operation of the relevant device or the
management of relevant activities. It was submitted that if the electronic evidence was
relevant and produced by a person who was not in custody of the device from which the
electronic document was generated, requirement of such certificate could not be
mandatory. It was submitted that Section 65B of the Evidence Act was a procedural
provision to prove relevant admissible evidence and was intended to supplement the
law on the point by declaring that any information in an electronic record, covered by
the said provision, was to be deemed to be a document and admissible in any
proceedings without further proof of the original. This provision could not be read in
derogation of the existing law on admissibility of electronic evidence.
6 . We have been taken through certain decisions which may be referred to. In Ram
Singh and Ors. v. Col. Ram Singh, MANU/SC/0176/1985 : 1985 (Supp) SCC 611, a
Three-Judge Bench considered the said issue. English Judgments in R. v. Maqsud Ali,
(1965) 2 All ER 464, and R. v. Robson, (1972) 2 ALL ER 699, and American Law as
noted in American Jurisprudence 2d (Vol. 29) page 494, were cited with approval to the
effect that it will be wrong to deny to the law of evidence advantages to be gained by
new techniques and new devices, provided the accuracy of the recording can be proved.
Such evidence should always be regarded with some caution and assessed in the light
of all the circumstances of each case. Electronic evidence was held to be admissible
subject to safeguards adopted by the Court about the authenticity of the same. In the
case of tape-recording it was observed that voice of the speaker must be duly identified,
accuracy of the statement was required to be proved by the maker of the record,
possibility of tampering was required to be ruled out. Reliability of the piece of evidence
is certainly a matter to be determined in the facts and circumstances of a fact situation.
However, threshold admissibility of an electronic evidence cannot be ruled out on any
technicality if the same was relevant.
7. In Tukaram S. Dighole v. Manikrao Shivaji Kokate, MANU/SC/0086/2010 : (2010) 4
SCC 329, the same principle was reiterated. This Court observed that new techniques
and devices are order of the day. Though such devices are susceptible to tampering, no
exhaustive Rule could be laid down by which the admission of such evidence may be
judged. Standard of proof of its authenticity and accuracy has to be more stringent than
other documentary evidence.
8. In Tomaso Bruno and Anr. v. State of Uttar Pradesh, MANU/SC/0057/2015 : (2015) 7
SCC 178, a Three-Judge Bench observed that advancement of information technology
and scientific temper must pervade the method of investigation. Electronic evidence was
relevant to establish facts. Scientific and electronic evidence can be a great help to an
investigating agency. Reference was made to the decisions of this Court in Mohd. Ajmal
Amir Kasab v. State of Maharashtra, MANU/SC/0681/2012 : (2012) 9 SCC 1 andS tate
(NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu, MANU/SC/0465/2005 : (2005) 11 SCC 600.
9. We may, however, also refer to judgment of this Court in Anvar P.V. v. P.K. Basheer
and Ors. MANU/SC/0834/2014 : (2014) 10 SCC 473, delivered by a Three-Judge Bench.
In the said judgment in para 24 it was observed that electronic evidence by way of
primary evidence was covered by Section 62 of the Evidence Act to which procedure of
Section 65B of the Evidence Act was not admissible. However, for the secondary
evidence, procedure of Section 65B of the Evidence Act was required to be followed and
a contrary view taken in Navjot Sandh (supra) that secondary evidence of electronic
record could be covered Under Sections 63 and 65 of the Evidence Act, was not correct.
There are, however, observations in para 14 to the effect that electronic record can be
proved only as per Section 65B of the Evidence Act.
10. Though in view of Three-Judge Bench judgments in Tomaso Bruno and Ram Singh
(supra), it can be safely held that electronic evidence is admissible and provisions
Under Sections 65A and 65B of the Evidence Act are by way of a clarification and are
procedural provisions. If the electronic evidence is authentic and relevant the same can
certainly be admitted subject to the Court being satisfied about its authenticity and
procedure for its admissibility may depend on fact situation such as whether the person
producing such evidence is in a position to furnish certificate Under Section 65B(h).
11. Sections 65A and 65B of the Evidence Act, 1872 cannot be held to be a complete
code on the subject. In Anvar P.V. (supra), this Court in para 24 clarified that primary
evidence of electronic record was not covered Under Sections 65A and 65B of the
Evidence Act. Primary evidence is the document produced before Court and the
expression ""document"" is defined in Section 3 of the Evidence Act to mean any matter
expressed or described upon any substance by means of letters, figures or marks, or by
more than one of those means, intended to be used, or which may be used, for the
purpose of recording that matter.
1 2 . The term ""electronic record"" is defined in Section 2(t) of the Information
Technology Act, 2000 as follows:
Electronic record"" means data, record or data generated, image or sound
stored, received or sent in an electronic form or micro film or computer
generated micro fiche.
13. Expression ""data"" is defined in Section 2(o) of the Information Technology Act as
follows.
Data"" means a representation of information, knowledge, facts, concepts or
instructions which are being prepared or have been prepared in a formalised
manner, and is intended to be processed, is being processed or has been
processed in a computer system or computer network, and may be in any form
(including computer printouts magnetic or optical storage media, punched
cards, punched tapes) or stored internally in the memory of the computer.
14. The applicability of procedural requirement Under Section 65B(4) of the Evidence
Act of furnishing certificate is to be applied only when such electronic evidence is
produced by a person who is in a position to produce such certificate being in control of
the said device and not of the opposite party. In a case where electronic evidence is
produced by a party who is not in possession of a device, applicability of Sections 63
and 65 of the Evidence Act cannot be held to be excluded. In such case, procedure
under the said Sections can certainly be invoked. If this is not so permitted, it will be
denial of justice to the person who is in possession of authentic evidence/witness but
on account of manner of proving, such document is kept out of consideration by the
court in absence of certificate Under Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act, which party
producing cannot possibly secure. Thus, requirement of certificate Under Section 65B(h)
is not always mandatory.
15. Accordingly, we clarify the legal position on the subject on the admissibility of the
electronic evidence, especially by a party who is not in possession of device from which
the document is produced. Such party cannot be required to produce certificate Under
Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act. The applicability of requirement of certificate being
procedural can be relaxed by Court wherever interest of justice so justifies.
16. To consider the remaining aspects, including finalisation of the road-map for use of
the videography in the crime scene and the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), we
adjourn the matter to 13th February, 2018.
17. We place on record our deep appreciation for the valuable assistance rendered by
learned amicus, Mr. Jayant Bhushan, senior advocate, Ms. Meenakshi Arora, senior
advocate, who was assisted by Ms. Ananya Ghosh, Advocate, as well as by Mr. Yashank
Adhyaru, learned senior Counsel, and Ms. Shirin Khajuria, learned Counsel, appearing

(i) The applicability of procedural requirement under Section 65B(4) of the
Evidence Act of furnishing certificate is to be applied only when such
electronic evidence is produced by a person who is in a position to produce
such certificate being in control of the said device and not of the opposite
party. In a case where electronic evidence is produced by a party who was not
in possession of a device, applicability of Sections 63 and 65 of the Evidence
Act could not be held to be excluded. In such case, procedure under the said
Sections can certainly be invoked. If this was not so permitted, it will be
denial of justice to the person who was in possession of authentic
evidence/witness but on account of manner of proving, such document is kept
out of consideration by the court in absence of certificate under Section
65B(4) of the Evidence Act, which party producing could not possibly secure.
Thus, requirement of certificate Under Section 65B(4) is not always
mandatory. Such party could not be required to produce certificate under
Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act. The applicability of requirement of
certificate being procedural could be relaxed by the Court wherever interest of
justice so justifies. [14] and[15]",,,,

3. Heard Mr. Siddharth Luthra, learned senior Counsel for the Appellant and Mr. Mahesh
Jethmalani, learned senior Counsel for Respondent No. 2 and Mr. Nishant R.
Katneshwarkar, learned Counsel for the Respondent-State.
Point(s) for consideration:
4. The only point for consideration before this Court is whether in the present facts and
circumstances of the case, the Appellant has made out a case for inclusion of Section
366 of the Indian Penal Code in the charges framed or not?
5. We have heard the arguments advanced by both the sides and perused the records.
Rival contentions:
6 . Learned senior Counsel for the Appellant contended that the incident took place on
06/07.09.2003 and FIR got registered on 12.09.2003 on the complaint made by the
Appellant. Further, the Appellant gave a supplementary statement on 16.02.2004 and if
the complaint and the supplementary statement is taken in its true perspective, no case
has been made out for the discharge of Respondent No. 2 in respect of the alleged
offences Under Sections 366, 363 and 506(ii) of the Indian Penal Code.
7. In support of his contention, learned senior Counsel for the Appellant has relied upon
Cref Finance Ltd. v. Shree Shanthi Homes (P) Ltd. and Anr. MANU/SC/0524/2005
: (2005) 7 SCC 467. He, therefore, contended that the impugned order as also the order
of the Sessions Court discharging Respondent No. 2 be set aside by this Court.
8 . Learned senior Counsel for Respondent No. 2, however, submitted that there is no
whisper in the complaint on the basis of which FIR was registered on 12.09.2003
regarding commission of offences Under Sections 366, 363 and 506(ii) of the Indian
Penal Code and the supplementary statement given by the Appellant after about 5 (five)
months is only an afterthought just to implicate Respondent No. 2 under other Sections
also and, therefore, it cannot be relied upon.
9. Learned senior Counsel for Respondent No. 2 referred to a decision of this Court in
Dharam Pal and Ors. v. State of Haryana and Anr. MANU/SC/0720/2013 : (2014)
3 SCC 306 and submitted that the order passed by the High Court and the Sessions
Court not call for any interference.
Discussion:
10. In the above backdrop, it is pertinent to mention here the ingredients of Section
366 of the Indian Penal Code which are as under:
3 6 6 ""Kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her
marriage, etc.--Whoever kidnaps or abducts any woman with intent that she
may be compelled, or knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled, to
marry any person against her will, or in order that she may be forced or
seduced to illicit intercourse, or knowing it to be likely that she will be forced
or seduced to illicit intercourse, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extent do ten years, and shall also be liable to
fine; and whoever, by means of criminal intimidation as defined in this Code or
of abuse of authority or any other method of compulsion, induces any woman
to go from any place with intent that she may be, or knowing that it is likely
that she will be, forced or seduced to illicit intercourse with another person
shall be punishable as aforesaid.
In order to constitute the offence of 'abduction' a person must be carried off illegally by
force or deception, that is, to compel a person by force or deceitful means to induce to
go from one place to another. The intention of the Accused is the basis and the
gravamen of an offence under this Section. The volition, the intention and the conduct
of the Accused determine the offence; they can only bear upon the intent with which the
Accused kidnapped or abducted the woman, and the intent of the Accused is the vital
question for determination in each case. Once the necessary intent of the Accused is
established, the offence is complete, whether or not the Accused succeeded in effecting
his purpose, and whether or not the woman consented to the marriage or the illicit
intercourse.
11. Apart from this, to constitute an offence Under Section 366 Indian Penal Code, it is
necessary for the prosecution to prove that the Accused induced the complainant
woman or compelled by force to go from any place, that such inducement was by
deceitful means, that such abduction took place with the intent that the complainant
may be seduced to illicit intercourse and/or that the Accused knew it to be likely that
the complainant may be seduced to illicit intercourse as a result of her abduction. Mere
abduction does not bring an Accused under the ambit of this penal section. So far as
charge Under Section 366 Indian Penal Code is concerned, mere finding that a woman
was abducted is not enough, it must further be proved that the Accused abducted the
woman with the intent that she may be compelled, or knowing it to be likely that she
will be compelled to marry any person or in order that she may be forced or seduced to
illicit intercourse or knowing it to be likely that she will be forced or seduced to illicit
intercourse. Unless the prosecution proves that the abduction is for the purposes
mentioned in Section 366 Indian Penal Code, the Court cannot hold the Accused guilty
and punish him Under Section 366 Indian Penal Code.
12. We are of the considered opinion that the essence of all the applications and orders
filed before the courts below is same. There is no point in considering that in all the
courts below, the other applications filed by Respondent No. 2 were not brought to the
notice of the court at this stage. In this view of the matter, it would be appropriate if we
would confine our discussion to the applicability of Section 366 of the Indian Penal
Code in the present facts and circumstances of the case.
1 3 . In the case at hand, the Appellant herein and Respondent No. 2 were in a
relationship. On 06.09.2003, the Appellant herein and Respondent No. 2 attended a
birthday party of one of their friends. As per the allegations in the complaint, in the
early hours of 07.09.2003, when all the friends proceeded towards the venue for dinner,
Respondent No. 2 herein, in order to drop her to the venue, took her to his house at
Cuffe Parade, Mumbai and asked her to get down from the car. When she refused for
the same, Respondent No. 2 forcibly pulled her out of the car and lifted her up and took
her to his house and put her on his bed. After this, Respondent No. 2 herein started
saying ""I love you and why are you not marrying me"" and started beating her with his
hands and belt. He also hit her head across the wall. As a result, she sustained injuries
on her person. At around 2 a.m., when the father of Respondent No. 2 returned home,
he took the Appellant herein to her home. On 12.09.2003, FIR was got registered under
various Sections of the Indian Penal Code. One week thereafter, i.e. on 19.09.2003, a
further statement was given by the Appellant, after explaining the facts to her mother
wherein the Appellant has made out a case of being molested. Her explanation that it
was not stated earlier due to embarrassment does not inspire confidence as FIR was
lodged five days' after the incident and, therefore, she lodged the same with due
deliberation. Again, why within one week thereafter she thought of mentioning about
the molestation and did not feel embarrassed now? There is no explanation for that. The
act of pulling out the Appellant herein from the car of Respondent No. 2 was witnessed
by the watchman. In this view of the matter, it is apparently clear that the allegation is
confined to aspect of Respondent No. 2 herein forcibly taking her to his house.
However, the allegations of removing her clothes and touching her inappropriately or
molestation was added afterwards. This Court has time and again held that mere
abduction does not bring an Accused under the ambit of Section 366 Indian Penal Code.
It must be proved that the Accused abducted the woman with the intent that she may be
compelled, or knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled to marry any person or
in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse or knowing it to be
likely that she will be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse. It is evident on record that
Respondent No. 2 and the Appellant herein were in a relationship which was known to
their families also. The primary allegations are that Respondent No. 2 took her forcibly
to his house. But it was not with intent to seduce her to illicit intercourse. Actually, as
per the prosecutrix, Respondent No. 2 first expressed his love for her and afterwards he
started beating her with waist belt and using his hands which fact is evident on record.
The statement of being molested at the hands of Respondent No. 2 was not given at
once and was given later. The very same acts of Respondent No. 2 do not show his
intent to abduct her in order to marry her against her will or to force her or seduce her
to illicit intercourse.
14. Even if it is proved that Respondent No. 2 forcibly took her to his house, but the
later version that his intention was to marry her or to force or seduce her to illicit
intercourse is clearly an afterthought. At the highest, the case can be put that both of
them were in a relationship and due to sudden outbreak of emotions or due to sense of
insecurity on the part of Respondent No. 2, the above act was done. Further, the
decisions relied upon by learned senior Counsel for the parties have no application to
the facts of the present case.
15. In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the opinion that the charge Under
Section 366 of the Indian Penal Code is not maintainable and the High Court was right
in upholding so. We are in agreement with the order passed by the High Court.
However, since the matter is pending since 2003 and is still at the stage of charge
framing, we deem it appropriate to direct the trial Court to conclude the trial within 6
(months) from the date of passing of this judgment. It is also made clear that the
observations recorded in this judgment are for the purpose of applicability of Section
366 of the Indian Penal Code only and trial Court shall decide the matter on merits. The
appeal is dismissed.","Appellants: Kavita Chandrakant Lakhani

Trial Court discharged Respondent not only in respect of offence under
Section 366 of Code but also under Sections 363 and 506(ii) of Code.
Aggrieved by above order, Appellant preferred petition before High Court. High
Court dismissed petition filed by Appellant. Hence, present appeal was filed by
Appellant.
Held, while dismissing the appeal:
(i) It was apparently clear that allegation was confined to aspect of
Respondent forcibly taking her to his house. Allegations of removing her
clothes and touching her inappropriately or molestation was added
afterwards. Court had held that mere abduction did not bring Respondent
under ambit of Section 366 Code. It must be proved that Respondent
abducted woman with intent that she might be compelled, or knowing it to be
likely that she would be compelled to marry any person or in order that she
might be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse or knowing it to be likely that
she would be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse. It was evident on record
that Respondent and Appellant were in relationship which was known to their
families also. As per prosecutrix, Respondent first expressed his love for her
and afterwards he started beating her with waist belt and using his hands
which fact was evident on record. The statement of being molested at hands
of Respondent was not given at once and was given later. The very same acts
of Respondent did not show his intent to abduct her in order to marry her
against her will or to force her or seduce her to illicit intercourse. [13]
(ii) Charge under Section 366 of Code was not maintainable and High Court

1 . This appeal is filed by the Accused against the final judgment and order dated
26.06.2006 passed by the High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital in Criminal Appeal No.
368 of 2004 whereby the High Court confirmed the judgment and order dated
09.11.2004 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court II, Udham Singh
Nagar in Special Sessions Trial No. 20 of 2003 by which the Appellant-accused was
convicted for the offence punishable Under Section 20 of the Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (hereinafter referred to as ""the NDPS Act"") and
sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and a fine of Rs.
1,00,000/-.
2 . In order to appreciate the issue involved in the appeal, few facts need to be
mentioned hereinbelow.
3. In short, the case of the prosecution is as under:
4. On 23.11.2002, a secret information was received in P.S. Kichha from one unknown
informant that one person is travelling in a roadways bus carrying with him some
contraband articles. The secret informant also gave information that the person
concerned would get down near the railway crossing from the Bus and would approach
towards a place called ""Chowki Pul Bhatta"" along with contraband article.
5 . The raiding party headed by SHO-Harish Mehra, who was on duty at P.S. Kichha
along with the police officials on duty accordingly left for the place informed by the
informant.
6. On reaching the informed place, the raiding party waited for sometime and thereafter
spotted the person concerned, who was approaching towards the place informed to
them. The raiding party intercepted the person concerned.
7 . Thereafter, the Accused was asked by the police personnel of raiding party as to
whether he is in possession of contraband ""Charas"". The Accused admitted that he is in
possession of ""Charas"". On apprehending the accused, he was informed by the police
personnel that he has a legal right to be searched in the presence of a Gazetted Officer
or a Magistrate to which the Accused replied that he has a faith on the raiding police
party and consented to be searched by them.
8 . The raiding police party accordingly obtained his consent in writing to be searched
by the raiding police party. The raiding police party then searched the Accused which
resulted in seizure of ""Charas"" weighing around 2.5 K.G. in quantity from his body.
9 . It is this incident, which gave rise to prosecution of the Appellant (accused) for
commission of the offence punishable Under Section 20 of the NDPS Act in Special
Sessions Trial No. 20/2003. After investigation, the prosecution filed the charge sheet
(Ex- 11) against the Appellant and examined 5 witnesses to bring home the charge
levelled against the Appellant.
1 0 . By order dated 09.11.2004, the Additional Sessions Judge/Fast Track Court II,
Udham Singh Nagar held that the prosecution was able to prove the case beyond
reasonable doubt against the Appellant and accordingly convicted him for the offences
punishable Under Section 20 of the NDPS Act and sentenced him to undergo rigorous
imprisonment for 10 years and a fine of Rs. 1,00,000/-.
1 1 . The Accused felt aggrieved and filed appeal in the High Court at Nainital. By
impugned judgment, the High Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the order of
Additional Sessions Judge, which has given rise to filing of the present appeal by the
Accused by way of special leave in this Court.
12. Heard Mr. J.C. Gupta, learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant (accused) and Mr.
Ashutosh Kumar Sharma, learned Counsel for the Respondent-State.
1 3 . Learned Counsel for the Appellant (accused) while assailing the legality and
correctness of the impugned judgment contended that both the Courts below erred in
holding the Appellant guilty of commission of the offence in question and thus erred in
convicting him for the alleged offence under the NDPS Act.
14. Learned Counsel contended that the prosecution has failed to ensure mandatory
compliance of Section 50 of the NDPS Act inasmuch as the alleged recovery/search of
the contraband (Charas) made by the raiding police party from the Appellant's body was
not done in accordance with the procedure prescribed Under Section 50 of the NDPS Act
which according to learned Counsel is mandatory as held by this Court in the case of
Vijaysinh Chandubha Jadeja v. State of Gujarat MANU/SC/0913/2010 : 2011 (1)
SCC 609.
15. Learned Counsel urged that the search/recovery of the alleged contraband from the
Appellant ought to have been made only in the presence of either a Magistrate or a
Gazetted Officer only.
1 6 . It was urged that since admittedly the prosecution did not make the
search/recovery from the Appellant in the presence of a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer
and, therefore, the alleged recovery of the contraband ""Charas"" from the Appellant is
rendered illegal being in contravention of requirements of Section 50 of the NDPS Act
thereby entitling the Appellant for an acquittal from the charges.
1 7 . In reply, learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent (State) supported the
reasoning and conclusion arrived at in the impugned judgment and, therefore, prayed
for upholding of the impugned judgment.
18. Having heard the learned Counsel for the parties and on perusal of the record of the
case, we are inclined to allow the appeal and while setting aside of the impugned
judgment acquit the Appellant from the charges in question.
1 9 . The short question which arises for consideration in the appeal is whether the
search/recovery made by the police officials from the Appellant (accused) of the alleged
contraband (charas) can be held to be in accordance with the procedure prescribed
Under Section 50 of the NDPS Act.
20. In other words, the question that arises for consideration in this appeal is whether
the prosecution was able to prove that the procedure prescribed Under Section 50 of the
NDPS Act was followed by the Police Officials in letter and spirit while making the
search and recovery of the contraband ""Charas"" from the Appellant (accused).
21. What is the true scope and object of Section 50 of the NDPS Act, what are the
duties, obligation and the powers conferred on the authorities Under Section 50 and
whether the compliance of requirements of Section 50 are mandatory or directory,
remains no more res integra and are now settled by the two decisions of the
Constitution Bench of this Court in State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh
MANU/SC/0981/1999 : (1999) 6 SCC 172 and Vijaysinh Chandubha Jadeja (supra).
22. Indeed, the latter Constitution Bench decision rendered in the case of Vijaysinh
Chandubha Jadeja (supra) has settled the aforementioned questions after taking into
considerations all previous case law on the subject.
2 3 . Their Lordships have held in Vijaysinh Chandubha Jadeja (supra) that the
requirements of Section 50 of the NDPS Act are mandatory and, therefore, the
provisions of Section 50 must be strictly complied with. It is held that it is imperative
on the part of the Police Officer to apprise the person intended to be searched of his
right Under Section 50 to be searched only before a Gazetted officer or a Magistrate. It
is held that it is equally mandatory on the part of the authorized officer to make the
suspect aware of the existence of his right to be searched before a Gazetted Officer or a
Magistrate, if so required by him and this requires a strict compliance. It is ruled that
the suspect person may or may not choose to exercise the right provided to him Under
Section 50 of the NDPS Act but so far as the officer is concerned, an obligation is cast
upon him Under Section 50 of the NDPS Act to apprise the suspect of his right to be
searched before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate. (See also Ashok Kumar Sharma v.
State of Rajasthan MANU/SC/0019/2013 : 2013 (2) SCC 67 andN arcotics Control
Bureau v. Sukh Dev Raj Sodhi, MANU/SC/0650/2011 : 2011 (6) SCC 392)
24. Keeping in view the aforementioned principle of law laid down by this Court, we
have to examine the question arising in this case as to whether the prosecution followed
the mandatory procedure prescribed Under Section 50 of the NDPS Act while making
search and recovery of the contraband ""Charas"" from the Appellant and, if so, whether it
was done in the presence of a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer so as to make the search
and recovery of contraband ""Charas"" from the Appellant in conformity with the
requirements of Section 50.
25. In our considered view, the evidence adduced by the prosecution neither suggested
and nor proved that the search and the recovery was made from the Appellant in the
presence of either a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer.
26. It is the case of the prosecution and which found acceptance by the two Courts
below that since the Appellant (accused) was apprised of his right to be searched in the
presence of either a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer but despite telling him about his
legal right available to him Under Section 50 in relation to the search, the Appellant
(accused) gave his consent in writing to be searched by the police officials (raiding
party), the two Courts below came to a conclusion that the requirements of Section 50
stood fully complied with and hence the Appellant was liable to be convicted for the
offence punishable under the NDPS Act.
27. We do not agree to this finding of the two Courts below as, in our opinion, a search
and recovery made from the Appellant of the alleged contraband ""Charas"" does not
satisfy the mandatory requirements of Section 50 as held by this Court in the case of
Vijaysinh Chandubha Jadeja (supra). This we say for the following reasons.
28. First, it is an admitted fact emerging from the record of the case that the Appellant
was not produced before any Magistrate or Gazetted Officer; Second, it is also an
admitted fact that due to the aforementioned first reason, the search and recovery of the
contraband ""Charas"" was not made from the Appellant in the presence of any Magistrate
or Gazetted Officer; Third, it is also an admitted fact that none of the police officials of
the raiding party, who recovered the contraband ""Charas"" from him, was the Gazetted
Officer and nor they could be and, therefore, they were not empowered to make search
and recovery from the Appellant of the contraband ""Charas"" as provided Under Section
50 of the NDPS Act except in the presence of either a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer;
Fourth, in order to make the search and recovery of the contraband articles from the
body of the suspect, the search and recovery has to be in conformity with the
requirements of Section 50 of the NDPS Act. It is, therefore, mandatory for the
prosecution to prove that the search and recovery was made from the Appellant in the
presence of a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer.
29. Though, the prosecution examined as many as five police officials (PW-1 to PW-5)
of the raiding police party but none of them deposed that the search/recovery was made
in presence of any Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer.
3 0 . For the aforementioned reasons, we are of the considered opinion that the
prosecution was not able to prove that the search and recovery of the contraband
(Charas) made from the Appellant was in accordance with the procedure prescribed
Under Section 50 of the NDPS Act. Since the non-compliance of the mandatory
procedure prescribed Under Section 50 of the NDPS Act is fatal to the prosecution case
and, in this case, we have found that the prosecution has failed to prove the compliance
as required in law, the Appellant is entitled to claim its benefit to seek his acquittal.
3 1 . In the light of the foregoing discussion, the appeal succeeds and is allowed.
Impugned judgment is set aside. As a consequence thereof, the Appellant's conviction is
set aside and he is acquitted of the charges in question.","Appellants: Arif Khan

Charge was framed against Appellant under Section 20 of Act. Trial Court held
that prosecution was able to prove case beyond reasonable doubt against
Appellant and accordingly convicted him for said offences and sentenced him
to undergo rigorous imprisonment. Appellant filed appeal in High Court which
was dismissed. Hence, present appeal was filed by Appellant.
Held, while allowing the appeal:
(i) Evidence adduced by prosecution neither suggested and nor proved that
search and recovery was made from Appellant in presence of either Magistrate
or Gazetted Officer. [25]
(ii) It was case of prosecution and which found acceptance by Courts below
that since Appellant was apprised of his right to be searched in presence of
either Magistrate or Gazetted Officer but despite telling him about his legal
right available to him, Appellant gave his consent in writing to be searched by
police officials, two Courts below came to conclusion that requirements of
Section 50 stood fully complied with and hence Appellant was liable to be
convicted for offence punishable under Act. [26]
(iii) Though, prosecution examined as many as five police officials of raiding
police party but none of them deposed that search/recovery was made in
presence of any Magistrate or Gazetted Officer. [29]
(iv) Prosecution was not able to prove that search and recovery of contraband
substance made from Appellant was in accordance with procedure prescribed
under Section 50 of Act and hence Appellant was liable to be acquitted. [30]",,,,

1 . The present Special Leave Petitions have been filed against the common judgment
and order dated 27.09.2013 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in
Criminal Revision Case Nos. 1657 and 1658 of 2008. That after issuance of notice,
Special Leave Petitions were heard finally.
Leave granted.
(1.1) These Appeals arise out of two complaints filed Under Section 138 of the
Negotiable Instruments Act (""the N.I. Act"") filed by the Appellants against the
Respondent for dishonour of two cheques of Rs. 37,00,000/- and Rs.
14,00,000/- respectively.
2. The facts of the case briefly stated are as under:
(2.1) The Appellants submit that they were inducted in Maanihada Tea Produce
Company Pvt. Ltd. being run by the Respondent to infuse capital by way of
deposits and shares.
(2.2) On 24.11.1998, the Appellants resigned as Directors of the Company after
which the Respondent and his son, DW-3, remained incharge of the Company.
The Appellants submitted that the Respondent failed to return their share in the
company. The Appellants made demands for re-payment of their dues.
On 07.08.2002, the Respondent issued a Promissory Note for Rs. 51,00,000/-
in favour of K. Posa Nandhi-the Appellant in the Second Appeal. The Promissory
Note records that it was being issued against a loan. The Respondent also
issued two cheques on the same date, one for Rs. 37,00,000/- in favour of K.
Posa Nandhi, and the other for Rs. 14,00,000/- in favour of T.P. Murugan,
towards discharge of their liability for the investments made in M/s. Maanihada
Tea Produce Company.
(2.3) The cheques were presented for encashment on 03.02.2003 by the
Appellants, which were dishonoured due to ""Stop Payment"" instructions issued
by the Respondent.
(2.4) The Appellants issued the statutory notices Under Section 138 of the N.I.
Act calling upon the Respondent to discharge their debt/liability and clear their
dues.
(2.5) The Respondent vide his reply dated 17.02.2003 refuted the claim of the
Appellants.
(2.6) The Appellants filed two complaints Under Section 138 of the N.I. Act
before the Court of Judicial Magistrate II, Coimbatore.
(2.7) The Respondent contended that the signed blank Promissory Note was
issued by him in favour of N.R.R. Finances Investments Pvt. Ltd. under a hirepurchase
agreement for purchasing a lorry on loan basis. The said Promissory
Note was not issued in favour of the Appellant-complainants. The Promissory
Note was filled up by DW. 2 Mahesh, an employee of N.R.R. Investments, after
the signatures of the Respondent were obtained on the same.
With respect to the two cheques which were dishonoured, the Respondent
contended that these were amongst 10 blank cheques signed and handed over
to the Appellant-K. Posa Nandhi as security, when he borrowed Rs. 5,00,000/-
in 1995. That even though this loan was re-paid in 1996 with interest, the
cheques were not returned. The Respondent further contended that he had
issued a letter on 09.11.2002 asking the Appellants to return the 10 blank
cheques.
3 . The Trial Court found that the Respondent had admitted his signatures both on the
Pronote and also on the two cheques for Rs. 37,00,000/- and Rs. 14,00,000/-
respectively. The Respondent also admitted that the Appellant had invested capital in
their concern viz. M/s. Maanihada Tea Factory.
The Court disbelieved the version of the Respondent with respect to the 10 blank
cheques issued to the Appellant in 1995. The Respondent failed to place any material on
record to show that he had ever asked for return of the 10 blank cheques, allegedly
given by him to the Respondent, for seven years.
That after going through the detailed evidence adduced by the parties, the Trial Court
held that the Cheques and Pronote were issued for repayment/discharge of a lawful
debt. The Respondent was found guilty Under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, and
sentenced him to undergo R.I. for six months and Fine of Rs. 5000/-, failing which, he
shall undergo one month's R.I.
4. Aggrieved by the said judgment, the Respondent-Accused filed Criminal Appeal Nos.
437-438 of 2006 before the District and Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No. III,
Coimbatore. The District and Sessions Judge held that the presumption Under Sections
118 and 139 of the N.I. Act was not rebutted by the Respondent. It was proved by the
complainants that there were insufficient funds in the bank account of the Respondent
at the time of issuance of the cheques. The Respondent had with mala fide intention
issued ""Stop Payment"" instructions. The Respondent failed to give any explanation as to
how the Pronote came into possession of the Appellant. Furthermore, the Sessions
Court discarded the evidence adduced by the Accused, of DW. 2 Mahesh, as being an
interested witness, who had falsely stated that he was an employee of N.R.R. Finances.
This was rebutted by two witnesses viz. PW. 2 and PW. 4, who were Directors of N.R.R.
Finances who deposed that DW. 2 was never employed by this Company. The District
and Sessions Court affirmed the conviction and sentence awarded by the Trial Court.
5 . Aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 26.11.2008 passed by the District and
Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No. III, Coimbatore, the Respondent-Accused filed two
Criminal Revision Nos. 1657-1658 of 2008 before the Madras High Court. That even
though the Appellants herein-complainants had initially participated in the proceedings,
the present Appellant was unrepresented during the final hearing. The hearing of the
Criminal Revision Petitions proceeded ex parte.
The High Court recorded that the Respondent-Accused had not denied either the
issuance of the cheques, or his signatures on the Pronote and cheques. The denial was
only with regard to the circumstances, the manner and the period during which the
cheques were issued. The High Court took the view that the burden cast on the
Respondent-Accused was only to raise a doubt in the mind of the Court about the nature
of the transaction. The Ld. Single Judge accepted the contention of the Respondent that
since the cheques and the Pronote were issued on the same date, it could only be
treated as a security, and was not towards any debt or liability. By raising a doubt with
respect to the circumstances in which the Pronote and cheques were issued, the
Respondent had discharged the presumption Under Section 139 of the N.I. Act. The
High Court held that the Trial Court and the Sessions Court erred in applying the legal
principles of standard of proof for the complainant to prove their case.
The High Court, while exercising its revisional jurisdiction, reversed the concurrent
findings of the Courts below, and set aside the judgment of conviction and sentence
passed against the Accused.
6. Aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 27.09.2013 passed in Criminal Revision
Nos. 1657-1658 of 2008, the Appellant-complainants filed the present Special Leave
Petitions.
Mrs. V. Mohana, Sr. Adv. represented the Appellants, and submitted that the
Respondent-Accused has admitted his signatures on the two dishonoured cheques and
on the Pronote. The Appellants-complainants had adduced sufficient evidence to prove
their case. Reliance was placed by the Senior Counsel on the decisions of this Court in
Rangappa v. Shrimohan [MANU/SC/0376/2010 : (2010) 11 SCC 441], K.N. Beena v.
Muniyappan and Anr. [MANU/SC/0661/2001 : (2001)8 SCC 458]; and T.
Vasanthakumar v. Vijayakumari [MANU/SC/0498/2015 : (2015)8 SCC 378] in support
of her case.
7. Mr. R. Basanth, Sr. Counsel appeared on behalf of the Respondent-Accused, and
contended inter alia that the cheques were not issued towards discharge of a legally
enforceable debt, but as a security, and that the judgment under challenge required no
interference.
8 . We have heard Senior Counsel for both parties, and perused the record. Under
Section 139 of the N.I. Act, once a cheque has been signed and issued in favour of the
holder, there is statutory presumption that it is issued in discharge of a legally
enforceable debt or liability1. This presumption is a rebuttable one, if the issuer of the
cheque is able to discharge the burden that it was issued for some other purpose like
security for a loan.
In the present case, the Respondent has failed to produce any credible evidence to rebut
the statutory presumption. This would be evident from the following circumstances:
(i) The Respondent-Accused issued a Pronote for the amount covered by the
cheques, which clearly states that it was being issued for a loan;
(ii) The defence of the Respondent that he had allegedly issued 10 blank
cheques in 1995 for repayment of a loan, has been disbelieved both by the Trial
Court and Sessions Court, on the ground that the Respondent did not ask for
return of the cheques for a period of seven years from 1995. This defence was
obviously a cover-up, and lacked credibility, and hence was rightly discarded.
(iii) The letter dated 09.11.2002 was addressed by the Respondent after he had
issued two cheques on 07.08.2002 for Rs. 37,00,000/- and Rs. 14,00,000/-
knowing fully well that he did not have sufficient funds in his account. The
letter dated 09.11.2002 was an after-thought, and was written to evade
liability. This defence also lacked credibility, as the Appellants had never asked
for return of the alleged cheques for seven years.
(iv) The defence of the Respondent that the Pronote dated 07.08.2002 signed
by him, was allegedly filled by one Mahesh-DW. 2, an employee of N.R.R.
Finances, was rejected as being false. DW. 2 himself admitted in his crossexamination,
that he did not file any document to prove that he was employed
in N.R.R. Finances. On the contrary, the Appellants-complainants produced PW.
2 and PW. 4, Directors of N.R.R. Finances Investment Pvt. Ltd., and PW. 3, a
Member of N.R.R. Chit funds, who deposed that DW. 2 was never employed in
N.R.R. Finances.
9 . The Appellants have proved their case by overwhelming evidence to establish that
the two cheques were issued towards the discharge of an existing liability and legally
enforceable debt. The Respondent having admitted that the cheques and Pronote were
signed by him, the presumption Under Section 139 would operate. The Respondent
failed to rebut the presumption by adducing any cogent or credible evidence. Hence, his
defence is rejected.
1 0 . In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the impugned order dated
27.09.2013 passed in Criminal Revision Petition Nos. 1657 and 1658 of 2008 is hereby
set aside, and the order of Conviction and Fine passed by the Trial Court is restored.
11. The Appeals are allowed accordingly.","Appellants: T.P. Murugan (Dead) thr. L.Rs. and Ors.

Facts:
T h e complaints filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act
filed by the Appellants against the Respondent for dishonour of two cheques.
Trial Court held that the Cheques and Pronote were issued for
repayment/discharge of a lawful debt. The Respondent was found guilty
under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. The District and Sessions Court affirmed the
conviction and sentence awarded by the Trial Court. The High Court reversed
the concurrent findings of the Courts below, and set aside the judgment of
conviction.
Held, while allowing the appeal:
(i) Under Section 139 of the N.I. Act, once a cheque has been signed and
issued in favour of the holder, there is statutory presumption that it is issued
in discharge of a legally enforceable debt or liability1. This presumption is a
rebuttable one, if the issuer of the cheque is able to discharge the burden
that it was issued for some other purpose like security for a loan. In the
present case, the Respondent had failed to produce any credible evidence to
rebut the statutory presumption. [8]
(ii) The Appellants had proved their case by overwhelming evidence to
establish that the two cheques were issued towards the discharge of an
existing liability and legally enforceable debt. The Respondent having
admitted that the cheques and Pronote were signed by him, the presumption
under Section 139 of Act would operate. The Respondent failed to rebut the
presumption by adducing any cogent or credible evidence. Hence, his defence
was rejected. [9]
(iii) Thus, the impugned order was hereby set aside, and the order of
conviction and fine passed by the Trial Court was restored. [10]",,,,
"R. Banumathi, J.
1 . These appeals arise out of the judgment of the High court of Madhya Pradesh in
Criminal Death Reference No. 2 of 2008 in and by which the High Court has allowed the
appeal filed by the Respondents-Accused thereby acquitting the Respondents-Accused
Under Section 302 Indian Penal Code and setting aside the death penalty awarded to the
Respondents/Accused and his son Accused Akhilesh by the trial court.
2 . During the pendency of these appeals, Respondent No. 2-Akhilesh had died and by
the order dated 28.02.2017, the appeal against Respondent No. 2 was dismissed as
abated.
3 . Briefly stated case of the prosecution is that on 20.02.2006 at about 12.00-12.30
p.m., Kesar Bai (PW-1), her daughter-in-law deceased Phoolwati and grandson Rinku
aged three years were going towards the field to cut the mustard crop. Deceased
Ganeshi Bai who was the daughter of Kesar Bai (PW-1) and deceased Ganga Singh who
was the son of the jeth of Ganeshi Bai were little ahead to them. As soon as Kesar Bai
reached near Madhawala Danda on the public way, she heard the sound of four to five
gun-shots fired and saw the Accused firing at Ganga Singh and Ganeshi Bai. Thereafter,
Accused Chhaakki Lal and his son Akhilesh carrying the guns came towards them from
the front side. Chhaakki Lal told Kesar Bai (PW-1) that they have already killed her
daughter, Ganeshi Bai and Ganga Singh and now the turn is hers. Chhaakki Lal-Accused
No. 1 then fired at Phoolwati in her abdomen, the second fire was fired by Akhilesh-
Accused No. 2 at Rinku. Then Accused-Chhaakki Lal jumped on the child Rinku due to
which the intestines of Rinku tossed out because of the impact and as a result, he died
on the spot. Kesar Bai (PW-1) challenged the Accused persons and said 'what are you
waiting for, kill me now'. Chhaakki Lal is said to have replied that he would not kill her
as she will die automatically after looking at these incidents. Complaint-Dehati Nalishi
(Ex. P-1) was recorded on 20.02.2006 and after initial investigation, FIR was registered
Under Section 302 Indian Penal Code read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code and
Sections 25, 27, 29 and 30 of the Arms Act against both the Accused persons (Ex. P-25-
26).
4. Dr. S.K. Singh Niranjan (PW-6) conducted post-mortem on the dead bodies of all the
four deceased namely Phoolwati, Rinku Singh, Ganeshi Bai and Ganga Singh and noted
the injuries and issued post-mortem certificates. Accused Chhaakki Lal and Akhilesh
were arrested on 26.02.2006. Based on the disclosure statement of Chhaakki Lal-
Accused No. 1, a katta had been seized vide seizure memo Ex. P-20. Based on the
disclosure statement of Akhilesh-Accused No. 2, a 12 bore gun along with two live
cartridges of 12 bore was seized from Akhilesh. Also a gun licence of Accused-Chhaakki
Lal had been seized from Akhilesh vide seizure memo Ex. P-21. According to the FSL
reports (Exts. P-31, P-32 and P-33), the fired kartoos Ex. EC-1 to Ex. EC-4 had been
fired by pistol Ex. A-4, the two live kartoos Ex. LR-1 and LR-2 could be fired by 12 bore
gun/bandook (Ex. A-3), Exs. EB-1 and EB-2 was fired by rifle weapon. Ex.-EB-3 can be
part of Ex.-EB-2.
5 . To bring home the guilt of the Accused, prosecution has examined PW-1 to PW-13
and exhibited number of documents. The Accused were questioned Under Section 313
Code of Criminal Procedure about the incriminating evidence and circumstances and the
Accused denied all of them. Accused in their defence stated that deceased Ganga Singh
was a person of criminal character who was also in collusion with dacoits and engaged
in theft and snatching. The Accused persons have stated that due to previous enmity,
they have been falsely implicated. Upon consideration of evidence of Kesar Bai (PW-1)
and other evidence adduced by the prosecution, the trial court held Accused Nos. 1 and
2 guilty Under Section 302 Indian Penal Code read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code.
The trial court held that the case would come under the category of 'rarest of rare cases'
and awarded death penalty to both the Accused persons apart from imposing a fine of
R s . 5,000/- each. In appeal, the High court allowed the appeal preferred by the
Accused. The High Court found that the evidence of sole eye witness Kesar Bai (PW-1)
is not reliable and that the same is full of contradictions and omissions. The High Court
held that Kesar Bai (PW-1) is not a reliable witness and on those findings reversed the
verdict of conviction and acquitted the Accused persons.
6. Heard learned Counsel for the State of Madhya Pradesh and learned Counsel for the
Respondents/Accused. Learned Counsel for the State of Madhya Pradesh submitted that
the evidence of Kesar Bai (PW-1) was credible and acceptable and the same was
supported by other evidence and circumstances and the High Court erred in disbelieving
the evidence of Kesar Bai (PW-1). It was further contended that the delay in sending the
weapons for examination to Forensic Science Laboratory on 19.04.2006 which were
recovered on 01.03.2006 was a mistake/omission on the part of B.L. Dhanele-
Investigating Officer (PW-13) and the benefit of such omission cannot be given to the
Accused. It was urged that the High court was wrong in believing the story of the
defence to the effect that all the four deceased were killed by the dacoits as the
deceased Ganga Singh had illegal relations with the dacoits and the High court has
failed to see that the story of the defence was without any basis.
7. Contention of the Respondent/Accused is that Kesar Bai (PW-1) is not an honest and
trustworthy witness because there are lot of improvements on important aspects in her
court depositions on vital aspects. Assailing the evidence of Kesar Bai (PW-1), the
learned Counsel inter alia made the following submissions:
• In her court deposition, Kesar Bai (PW-1) claimed that she had witnessed the
murder of Ganga Singh and Ganeshi Bai whereas in the police complaint, she
stated that she heard four to five gun shots and thereafter when she reached
there, she saw the Respondents/Accused Chhaakki Lal and Akhilesh proceeding
towards them;
• Improved version of Kesar Bai (PW-1) as to the overt act attributed to
Chhaakki Lal that he threw Rinku on the ground and jumped upon his abdomen
region as a result of which his intestines came out did not find place in the FIR.
8 . The learned Counsel appearing for the Respondents-Accused submitted that the
evidence of sole witness Kesar Bai (PW-1) could not have formed the basis for
conviction and the High Court has rightly discarded the evidence of Kesar Bai (PW-1)
and has rightly set aside the conviction and acquitted the Accused.
9 . We have carefully considered the rival contentions and perused the impugned
judgment, evidence and materials placed on record. The point falling for consideration
is whether the High court was right in reversing the verdict of conviction of the
Respondents-Accused and acquitting them from the charges Under Section 302 Indian
Penal Code.
10. It is the case where four people were murdered in the broad day light. One of the
deceased-Rinku was a child of three years of age. Case of the prosecution is based upon
the sole testimony of Kesar Bai (PW-1). In her evidence, Kesar Bai (PW-1) has stated
that Ganga Singh and Ganeshi Bai had gone ahead for cutting the neem tree and that
she (PW-1), her daughter-in-law Phoolwati and grandson Rinku were following them.
Kesar Bai (PW-1) stated that when they reached at Madhawala Danda, Ganga Singh was
at a distance of 10-15 feet and that she saw Accused Chhaakki Lal and Akhilesh firing
gun-shot at Ganga Singh and thereafter firing gun-shot at Ganeshi Bai. Then Accused-
Chhaakki Lal and Akhilesh came towards Phoolwati and Chhaakki Lal fired the bullet in
the abdomen of Phoolwati. Akhilesh also fired at Phoolwati. Akhilesh fired at Rinku and
Chhaakki Lal had thrown Rinku on the ground. Chhaakki Lal also fired at Rinku.
Chhaakki Lal climbed over Rinku and jumped, due to which, his intestines came out.
When Kesar Bai (PW-1) told them to kill her also by firing, Chhaakki Lal replied that
they would not kill her and that she had to see all these things and then she would die
automatically.
11. Thakurdas (PW-2) who is Village Chowkidar stated that he had heard about the
incident from Kesar Bai (PW-1) and gone to the place of the incident and saw the dead
bodies of Ganga Singh, Ganeshi Bai, Phoolwati and Rinku. Thakurdas (PW-2) stated that
when he reached the village, Kesar Bai (PW-1) was weeping and she told him that
Chhaakki Lal and his son Akhilesh had committed all the four murders when they were
going towards the field.
12. The prosecution case revolves around the solitary testimony of eye-witness Kesar
Bai (PW-1) which was accepted by the trial court as trustworthy. While reversing the
verdict of conviction, the High Court held that the evidence of Kesar Bai (PW-1) is
fraught with inconsistencies and hence, her evidence is not reliable. The High court
pointed out that the evidence of Kesar Bai (PW-1) is exaggerated and that Accused-
Chhaakki Lal fired at Rinku is totally missing in her statement (Ex.-P1). The High Court
also pointed out further inconsistencies.
13. In her evidence before the court, Kesar Bai (PW-1) stated that when she and her
daughter-in-law Phoolwati and grandson Rinku reached near Madhawala Danda, other
deceased persons namely Ganeshi Bai and Ganga Singh were only ten paces away from
them and that she saw both the Accused firing at Ganga Singh and Ganeshi Bai and
thereafter the Accused came towards her. In Dehati Nalishi-complaint (Ex.-P1), Kesar
Bai (PW-1) stated that she heard four-five gun shots and then saw the Accused coming
towards her telling that they have killed Ganeshi Bai and Ganga Singh and then fired at
Phoolwati and child Rinku. The High Court held that in the version of Kesar Bai (PW-1)
before the court, there is a material improvement and that the evidence of Kesar Bai
(PW-1) is not reliable.
14. Of course, there is a slight improvement in the version of Kesar Bai (PW-1) before
the court but the circumstance under which Dehati Nalishi-complaint (Ex.-P1) was
recorded has to be seen. Kesar Bai (PW-1) has lost her four kith and kin. At the time
when Dehati Nalishi-complaint (Ex.-P1) was recorded, Kesar Bai (PW-1) must have
been grief-stricken and under mental trauma and she might have stated that she heard
four-five gun shots and then saw the dead bodies of Ganga Singh and Ganeshi Bai and
then the Accused came near Phoolwati and child Rinku and fired at them.
1 5 . Learned Counsel for the Respondent/Accused submitted that in her crossexamination,
Kesar Bai (PW-1) stated about one assailant Kailash and also named in
Dehati Nalishi and the said Kailash was detained by the police for one or two days after
the incident but later let off by the police because of the pressure. It was submitted that
mention of another assailant Kailash by Kesar Bai (PW-1) raises serious doubts about
the prosecution case. Ex.-P1-Dehati Nalishi was an earliest one lodged on the date of
incident on 20.02.2006 at 05.15 pm. Name of Kailash is not mentioned in Ex.-P1-Dehati
Nalishi. FIR (Ex.-P25-26) also does not contain the name of alleged assailant Kailash.
Since name of Kailash was not mentioned either in the Dehati Nalishi or FIR, the
answers elicited from Kesar Bai (PW-1) in the cross-examination regarding Kailash does
not affect her credibility. It is also pertinent to point out that in her cross-examination,
though Kesar Bai (PW-1) had stated that Kailash was taken to police custody after two
to three days of complaint, Kesar Bai (PW-1) stated that she cannot say that whether
police had taken Kailash to custody in connection with her case or other case.
16. Though much arguments are advanced regarding the alleged involvement of Kailash
and that he was taken to custody, the entire argument advanced qua one Kailash is
based upon certain answers elicited from Kesar Bai (PW-1). The Investigating Officer
has also denied that he has brought Kailash and one Ardaman and kept them in custody
for 4-5 days. He has also denied that based on the statement of Kesar Bai (PW-1), he
kept their guns. Investigating Officer has denied that he released both Kailash and
Ardaman due to some pressure and falsely involved Respondents/Accused. Investigating
Officer has also denied that Kesar Bai (PW-1) had told him that Kailash and Ardaman
had done the incident through dacoits. Investigating Officer has also denied that Kesar
Bai (PW-1) had named Kailash and Ardaman in her statement and the same was not
written by him. In the light of categorical denial by the investigation, there is no merit
in the contention of the Respondent/Accused as to the alleged involvement of Kailash.
17. In his evidence, Ram Naresh (PW-3) stated that the dead bodies of Ganeshi Bai and
Ganga Singh were found close to each other and that dead bodies of Phoolwati and
Rinku were at a distance of 25-30 feet away from the dead bodies of Ganeshi Bai and
Ganga Singh. In his statement, B.L. Dhanele-Investigating Officer (PW-13) has stated
that dead body of Phoolwati was at a distance of about fifty yards from the dead bodies
of Ganeshi Bai and Ganga Singh and that has been mentioned by him in the Site Plan
(Ex.-P24).
18. After referring to the Site Plan (Ex.-P24) and the evidence of Ram Naresh (PW-3)
and PW-13-IO, the trial court pointed out that the place where Phoolwati and Rinku
were shot and dead bodies of Ganeshi Bai and Ganga Singh were found, were at a short
distance of about fifty yards. The trial court observed that since the distance was not far
away, case of the prosecution that Ganga Singh, Ganeshi Bai, Phoolwati and Rinku were
all shot by the Accused in the course of the same transaction is established by the oral
evidence of Kesar Bai (PW-1) and also by the Site Plan (Ex.-P24). After referring to the
evidence of PW-13-Investigating Officer and Site Plan (Ex.-P24), when the trial court
has recorded that the firing of all the four deceased were in the course of the same
transaction, the High Court ought not to have doubted the version of Kesar Bai (PW-1)
on the slight improvement made in her evidence. For the sake of arguments, even
assuming that PW-1 could not have seen the firing at Ganeshi Bai and Ganga Singh, her
evidence is to be accepted to the extent of the occurrence of firing at deceased
Phoolwati and child Rinku. In her statement Kesar Bai (PW-1) has stated that after gun
shot fired at deceased Rinku, Accused-Chhaakki Lal threw the child Rinku on the ground
and also jumped on his abdomen, as a result of which intestines came out. The learned
Counsel for the Respondents-Accused submitted that Chhaakki Lal jumping on the
abdomen of the child Rinku was not mentioned in Dehati Nalishi (Ex. P.1) and FIR and
this material omission suggests that Kesar Bai (PW-1) exaggerated her version about
throwing of child Rinku on the floor and jumping on his abdominal region.
19. FIR is not an encyclopaedia which is expected to contain all the minute details of
the prosecution case, it may be sufficient if the broad effects of the prosecution case are
stated in the FIR. In this case, firing by Accused-Chhaakki Lal at child Rinku was stated
in the FIR and the omission of minute detail that Chhaakki Lal jumped on the abdomen
of child Rinku cannot be regarded as fatal to the prosecution case. As discussed earlier,
the effect of the occurrence on the mind of an old woman like Kesar Bai (PW-1) cannot
be measured in yardstick. Being grief-stricken because of the death of her four kith and
kin, it may not have occurred to Kesar Bai (PW-1) to narrate all the minute details of
the occurrence. The non-mention of Accused-Chhaakki Lal throwing the child Rinku on
the ground and jumping on his abdomen due to which the intestine came out cannot be
regarded as fatal to the prosecution case.
20. The High Court acquitted the Accused merely on the ground that the evidence of
Kesar Bai (PW-1) is fraught with contradictions. Kesar Bai (PW-1) was a rustic villager
and also aged. After seeing her own daughter and daughter in law and grandson being
put to death, she must have been under tremendous shock. Kesar Bai (PW-1) was
deposing in the court after some time. Naturally, there are bound to be variations from
her earlier version. The trial court which had the opportunity to observe the demeanour
of the witnesses found that the evidence of PWs is credible and trustworthy. While so,
the High Court ought not to have recorded a finding raising doubts about the credibility
of Kesar Bai (PW-1).
21. The trial court had the opportunity of seeing and observing the demeanour of the
witnesses and the views of the trial court as to the credibility of the witnesses is entitled
to great weight. Unless the appreciation of evidence by the trial court was vitiated by
serious error, the findings recorded by the trial court ought not to have been interfered
by the High Court.
22. In our considered view, the High court erred in doubting the testimony of Kesar Bai
(PW-1). It would be unreasonable to contend that merely because Kesar Bai (PW-1) is
related to the deceased and that there were contradictions in her evidence, her evidence
has to be discarded. Discrepancies which do not shake the credibility of the witness and
the basic version of the prosecution case are to be discarded. If the evidence of the
witness as a whole contains the ring of truth, the evidence cannot be doubted. In
Prithu alias Prithi Chand and Anr. v. State of Himachal Pradesh
MANU/SC/0318/2009 : (2009) 11 SCC 588, it was held as under:
14. In Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat
MANU/SC/0090/1983 : (1983) 3 SCC 217, it was observed that undue
importance should not be attached to omissions, contradictions and
discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and shake the basic
version of the prosecution witnesses. A witness cannot be expected to possess
a photographic memory and to recall the details of an incident verbatim.
Ordinarily, it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. A witness could
not have anticipated the occurrence which very often has an element of
surprise. The mental faculties cannot, therefore, be expected to be attuned to
absorb all the details. Thus, minor discrepancies were bound to occur in the
statement of witnesses.
The same principle was reiterated in State of U.P. v. M.K. Anthony
MANU/SC/0123/1984 : (1985) 1 SCC 505.
23. The High court proceeded on the footing that the evidence of Kesar Bai (PW-1)
being the solitary witness is not reliable to base the conviction unless corroborated in
material particulars. As discussed above, so far as the place of occurrence is concerned,
the evidence of PW-1 is amply corroborated by other evidence. It is fairly well settled
that it is not the number; but the quality of the evidence that matters. In terms of
Section 134 of the Evidence Act, ""no particular number of witnesses shall in any case be
required for the proof of any fact"". The test whether the evidence has a ring of truth is
cogent and trustworthy. In Prithipal Singh and Ors. v. State of Punjab and Anr.
MANU/SC/1292/2011 : (2012) 1 SCC 10, it was held as under:
49. This Court has consistently held that as a general Rule the court can and
may act on the testimony of a single witness provided he is wholly reliable.
There is no legal impediment in convicting a person on the sole testimony of a
single witness. That is the logic of Section 134 of the Evidence Act. But if there
are doubts about the testimony, the court will insist on corroboration. In fact, it
is not the number or the quantity, but the quality that is material. The timehonoured
principle is that evidence has to be weighed and not counted. The
test is whether the evidence has a ring of truth, is cogent, credible and
trustworthy or otherwise. The legal system has laid emphasis on value, weight
and quality of evidence, rather than on quantity, multiplicity or plurality of
witnesses. It is, therefore, open to a competent court to fully and completely
rely on a solitary witness and record conviction. Conversely, it may acquit the
Accused in spite of testimony of several witnesses if it is not satisfied about the
quality of evidence.
The same principle was reiterated in Sudip Kumar Sen alias Biltu v. State of West
Bengal and Ors. MANU/SC/0013/2016 : (2016) 3 SCC 26.
24. The version of the prosecution was doubted by the High Court on the ground that
FIR was registered after much delay. As per Dehati Nalishi-complaint (Ex.-P1), time of
incident was at about 12.00-12.30 pm on 20.02.2006 and Dehati Nalishi-complaint
(Ex.-P1) was written at 05.15 pm on the same day. PW-13-IO stated that on
20.02.2006, he was on duty at Health Mela in Senwdha and on receipt of information
from SDO Smt. Rekha Singh, he reached the place of occurrence and wrote Dehati
Nalishi-complaint (Ex.-P1). After the inquest and the preliminary investigation like
preparation of spot map, seizure etc. on 20.02.2006, FIR was registered on 21.02.2006
at about 02.00 pm. Ramveer (PW-8), son of Kesar Bai (PW-1) was not present in the
village and that he had gone to see his sister. When all the family members of PW-1
were killed and her son Ramveer (PW-8) away from the village, it cannot be accepted
from Kesar Bai (PW-1) a seventy years old rural woman to leave the dead bodies of
family members at the spot and go to the police station situated at a distance of ten
kilometres to lodge the complaint. As pointed out by the trial court, the delay in
registration of FIR has been properly explained.
25. Delay in setting the law in motion by lodging the complaint or registration of FIR is
normally viewed by courts with suspicion because there is possibility of concoction of
the case against the Accused. But when there is proper explanation for the delay, the
prosecution case cannot be doubted on the ground that there was delay in registration
of FIR. In this case, the delay in FIR has been properly explained and the same is not
fatal to the prosecution case.
2 6 . The High Court referred to the evidence of Mewalal (PW-11) who in his crossexamination
has stated that he saw PW-1 weeping at 08.00-09.00 am and that PW-1
told him that Accused persons have killed Ganga Singh, Ganeshi Bai, Phoolwati and
Rinku. Be it noted that Mewalal (PW-11) in his chief-examination stated that at about
12.00-12.30 pm, when he was present at his home in village Ruhera, he heard the firing
sound of five-six gun shots and that PW-1, mother-in-law of Phoolwati passed from the
passage crying and saying that the Accused Chhaakki Lal and Akhilesh had committed
the murder of her daughter-in-law Phoolwati, her grandson Rinku, Ganeshi Bai and
Ganga Singh in Mandawali Dang. Resiling from his version in the chief-examination, in
cross-examination, PW-11 stated that at about 08.00-09.00 am, when he was in his
house, PW-1 came to his house saying that Accused Chhaakki Lal and Akhilesh have
committed murder of her daughter-in-law Phoolwati, her grandson Rinku, Ganeshi Bai
and Ganga Singh. The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent/Accused
submitted that the prosecution has not treated PW-11 hostile and the statement of PW-
11 in his cross-examination throws serious doubts about the time and the manner of
occurrence. Of course, PW-11 was not treated hostile; but his prevaricating version
stood in the cross-examination neither affects his version in the chief-examination nor
does it affect the prosecution case. The High court was not right in doubting the
prosecution case and the trustworthiness of Kesar Bai (PW-1) based on the evidence of
an infirm witness like PW-11.
2 7 . The Accused were arrested on 26.02.2006 and on the basis of the disclosure
statement recorded Under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, on 01.03.2006, one 0.315
bore katta/desi pistol (Ex.-A4) was seized at the instance of Accused Chhaakki Lal vide
seizure memo Ex.-P20. One 12 bore gun (Ex.-A3) along with two live cartridges (Ex.-
EB1 and EB2) and a gun licence of Accused Chhaakki Lal have been seized under
seizure memo Ex.-P21 from Accused Akhilesh. One petal khoka of 0.315 bore (Ex.-P8)
was recovered from the dead body of Phoolwati. Two fired cartridges of 0.315 bore
(Ex.-P7) were found near the dead bodies of deceased Ganeshi Bai and Ganga Singh
respectively. In Ex.-P32 and Ex.-P33, the Ballistic expert opined that the fired kartoos
(Ex.-EC1 to EC4) have been fired from 0.315 bore katta/desi pistol (Ex.-A4). Likewise,
in Ex.-P32 and Ex.-P33, the Ballistic expert opined that the two live kartoos (Ex.-LR1
and LR2) could have been fired from 12 bore gun (Ex.-A3). The opinion of the Ballistic
expert tallying with the arms recovered from the Accused is seen from the following:
The opinion of the Ballistic expert that the fired kartoos has been fired by 0.315 bore
katta/desi pistol (Ex.-A4) recovered from Accused Chhaakki Lal and the opinion that live
kartoos (Ex.-EB1 and EB2) were fired from 12 bore gun (Ex.-A3) recovered from
Accused Akhilesh amply proves the involvement of the complicity of the Accused in the
occurrence thereby corroborating the evidence of PW-1.
2 8 . As pointed out earlier, country made pistol of 315 bore was recovered from
Chhaakki Lal on 01.03.2006 (seizure memo Ex.-P20) and 12 bore gun was recovered
from Akhilesh (Ex.-P21). Contention of the learned Counsel for the Respondent is that
Ex.-P20 refers to recovery of 315 bore katta whereas the FSL report (Ex.-P32) speaks
about the examination of country made pistol of 0.315 bore. Further contention of the
Respondent/Accused is that it has not been explained as to how country made pistol of
315 bore has been transformed into 0.315 bore during FSL report (Ex.-P32).
29. Of course, in Ex.-P20, it is stated that 315 bore katta was recovered from Chhaakki
Lal and the same is also mentioned in the sanction order under the Arms Act (Ex.-P14).
No doubt, in FSL report (Ex.-P32), the gun which was examined by the ballistic expert
is stated as 0.315 bore katta. There seems to be no variation in the pistol which was
seized by the police and the one that was examined by the ballistic expert. The
difference seems to be only in the description of 315 bore katta and 0.315 bore katta.
Investigating Officer who seized the weapon and the one who wrote Ex.-P20 are not
ballistic experts and are only laymen in so far as the examination of guns/pistol. Any
slight variation in the description of katta recovered from Chhaakki Lal does not make it
a different katta from the one which was examined by the ballistic expert (0.315 bore
katta).
30. Contention of the Respondent/Accused is that the FSL Report does not say anything
about the use of rifle by any of the assailants. It was submitted that EB-1 and EB-2
cannot be fired by a country made pistol of 0.315 bore or a gun of 12 bore and that EB-
1 and EB-2 must have been fired from some other big size gun. It was submitted that
Kesar Bai (PW-1) has named one Kailash in her cross-examination that the said Kailash
was kept in custody for about four to six days and the possibility that the gun recovered
from Kailash was planted on Chhaakki Lal cannot be ruled out. It was further submitted
that country made pistol examined by the FSL must have been recovered only from
Kailash and the discrepancies between the recovery and the FSL report has not been
properly explained.
31. It appears that there is No. 315 bore gun but only 0.315 bore gun. The description
given by the police that the recovered gun from Chhaakki Lal was 315 bore gun is only
a mistaken description.
3 2 . Investigating Officer has stated that Kesar Bai (PW-1) told in her statement
recorded by him that the Accused used big guns. Kesar Bai (PW-1) being a rustic village
woman may not have been in a position to give proper description of the gun; the
Accused cannot take advantage of the answers elicited from Kesar Bai (PW-1) that ""the
Accused persons were holding big size gun"" as it was only a manner of description
by a rustic villager like Kesar Bai (PW-1). The contention of the Respondents that only
""big sized gun"" stated by Kesar Bai (PW-1) could have been the gun of Kailash who was
taken to custody by the police along with his gun and later released. This contention
does not merit acceptance. Investigation Officer has categorically denied that the big
guns were of Kailash and Ardaman. Investigating Officer has also denied that because
of pressure he did not implicate Kailash and Ardaman and falsely implicated the
Accused.
33. For reversing the verdict of conviction, the High Court has pointed out that there
was delay in sending the seized gun and pistol (recovered on 01.03.2006) which was
sent to the FSL only on 19.04.2006. The High Court has doubted the case of
prosecution by observing that apart from delay in sending the seized guns/pistol, there
is no material showing as to where the seized weapons were kept during the period
from 01.03.2006 to 19.04.2006. Such delay in sending the recovered weapons to FSL
could only be an omission or lapse on the part of the Investigating Officer. Such
omissions or lapses in the investigation cannot be a ground to discard the prosecution
case which is otherwise credible and cogent. In Nankaunoo v. State of Uttar
Pradesh MANU/SC/0047/2016 : (2016) 3 SCC 317, it was held as under:
9. ...Any omission on the part of the investigating officer cannot go against the
prosecution case. Story of the prosecution is to be examined dehors such
omission by the investigating agency. Otherwise, it would shake the confidence
of the people not merely in the law enforcing agency but also in the
administration of justice.
3 4 . I n V.K. Mishra and Anr. v. State of Uttarakhand and Anr.
MANU/SC/0792/2015 : (2015) 9 SCC 588, it was held as under:
38. The investigating officer is not obliged to anticipate all possible defences
and investigate in that angle. In any event, any omission on the part of the
investigating officer cannot go against the prosecution. Interest of justice
demands that such acts or omission of the investigating officer should not be
taken in favour of the Accused or otherwise it would amount to placing a
premium upon such omissions.
35. We are conscious that in an appeal against acquittal, the appellate court would not
ordinarily interfere with the order of acquittal. But where the approach of the High Court
suffers from serious infirmity, this Court can reappreciate the evidence and reasonings
upon which the order of acquittal is based. A miscarriage of justice which may arise
from the acquittal of the guilty is no less than from the conviction of the innocent. Upon
reappreciation of the evidence and the reasonings of the trial court and the High Court,
in our considered view, the judgment of the High Court suffers from serious infirmity.
The High Court erred in doubting the version of PW-1-the sole eye witness whose
evidence is corroborated by the medical evidence and the evidence of ballistic expert.
The High Court did not appreciate the evidence of PW-1 in proper perspective and erred
in disbelieving her version on the contradictions which are not material. The High court
erred in rejecting the credible evidence of Kesar Bai (PW-1), which in our considered
view resulted in serious miscarriage of justice, where four persons were murdered.
36. Where the evidence has not been properly analysed or the High court has acted on
surmises and findings of the impugned judgment is unreasonable, it is the duty of the
appellate court to set right the wrong. In the instant case, the High court has ignored
the credible evidence of Kesar Bai (PW-1) and unnecessarily laid emphasis on the minor
contradictions and omissions. However, the order of acquittal by the High court cannot
be sustained and the judgment of the trial court is to be restored.
37. After convicting the Accused Chhaakki Lal and Akhilesh Under Section 302 Indian
Penal Code, the trial court held that the case would be one of the 'rarest of rare cases'
and awarded death penalty. The occurrence was of the year 2006 and moreover, the
appeal against second Accused-Akhilesh has been abated due to his passing away.
Therefore, considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the passage of time,
we are of the view that awarding of death penalty is not warranted and imposing
sentence of life imprisonment upon the Respondents/Accused Chhaakki Lal would meet
the ends of justice.
38. In the result, the impugned judgment is set aside and these appeals are allowed.
The judgment of the trial court convicting the Respondent/Accused Chhaakki Lal Under
Section 302 Indian Penal Code is restored and the Respondent/Accused is sentenced to
undergo imprisonment for life. The Respondent/Accused Chhaakki Lal shall surrender
himself forthwith within a week to serve the remaining sentence failing which he shall
be taken into custody.","Appellants: State of Madhya Pradesh and Ors.

Case Category:
CRIMINAL MATTERS - MATTERS FILED BY STATE AGAINST ACQUITTAL
Facts:
An FIR was registered under Section 302 Indian Penal Code read with Section
34 Indian Penal Code and Sections 25, 27, 29 and 30 of the Arms Act against
both the Accused persons. Trial court held Accused Nos. 1 and 2 guilty under
Section 302 Indian Penal Code read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code. The
trial court held that the case would come under the category of rarest of rare
cases and awarded death penalty to both the Accused persons. In appeal, the
High court allowed the appeal preferred by the Accused. The High Court found
that the evidence of sole eye witness was not reliable and that the same was
full of contradictions and omissions. The High Court held that was not a
reliable witness and on those findings reversed the verdict of conviction and
acquitted the Accused persons.
Held, while allowing the appeal:
(i) FIR was not an encyclopaedia which is expected to contain all the minute
details of the prosecution case, it may be sufficient if the broad effects of the
prosecution case are stated in the FIR. In this case, firing by Accused was
stated in the FIR and the omission of minute detail that accused jumped on
the abdomen of child could not be regarded as fatal to the prosecution case.
As discussed earlier, the effect of the occurrence on the mind of an old
woman like eye witness could not be measured in yardstick. Being griefstricken
because of the death of her four kith and kin, it may not have
occurred to eye witness to narrate all the minute details of the occurrence.
The non-mention of Accused throwing the child on the ground and jumping on
his abdomen due to which the intestine came out could not be regarded as
fatal to the prosecution case. [19]
(ii) The High Court acquitted the Accused merely on the ground that the
evidence of sole eye witness was fraught with contradictions. The sole eye
witness was a rustic villager and also aged. After seeing her own daughter
and daughter in law and grandson being put to death, she must have been
under tremendous shock. The eye witness was deposing in the court after
some time. Naturally, there are bound to be variations from her earlier
version. The trial court which had the opportunity to observe the demeanour
of the witnesses found that the evidence of sloe eye witness was credible and
trustworthy. While so, the High Court ought not to have recorded a finding
raising doubts about the credibility of sole eye witness. [20]
(iii) The High court erred in doubting the testimony of eye witness. It would
be unreasonable to contend that merely because eye witness was related to
the deceased and that there were contradictions in her evidence, her
evidence had to be discarded. Discrepancies which did not shake the
credibility of the witness and the basic version of the prosecution case were
to be discarded. If the evidence of the witness as a whole contains the ring of
truth, the evidence could not be doubted. [22]
(iv) The opinion of the Ballistic expert that the fired kartoos had been fired by
desi pistol were fired from twelve bore gun recovered from Accused amply
prove the involvement of the complicity of the Accused in the occurrence
thereby corroborating the evidence of eye witness. [27]
(v) Therefore, the impugned judgment was set aside. The judgment of the
trial court convicting the Respondent/Accused under Section 302 Indian
Penal Code was restored and the Respondent/Accused was sentenced to
undergo imprisonment for life. [38]",,,,
"N.V. Ramana, J.
1 . This appeal by way of special leave petition is filed by the State of Uttar Pradesh
against the final judgment and order dated 6th April, 2007 passed by the High Court of
Judicature at Allahabad in Criminal Appeal No. 2622 of 2005. By the said judgment, the
High Court has acquitted the Respondents who were Accused in Sessions Trial No. 1090
of 2003 before the District Court, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.
2 . The prosecution case, in brief, is that on 25-3-1993 at about 9.00 a.m. Mahipal
(deceased) and his wife Prakashee (PW3) were going to their fields on a buffalo cart
and Tej Pal, Ram Swaroop and Dharmendra (PW2) were following them. While they
were on their way, the three Accused (Respondents herein) appeared out of a sugarcane
filed near the fields of one Alias, while hurling abuses against Mahipal fired at him. The
fire opened by Om Pal was missed but the fire opened by Mukhtiar hit Mahipal. Navin
assaulted Mahipal with the butt of the Tamancha on his head. On receiving information
from Dharmendra (PW2) about the incident, Naresh (PW1) accompanied by Dharmendra
took the injured Mahipal to the police station, Babugarh and lodged FIR. Thereafter, on
the way to hospital, Mahipal succumbed to the injuries.
3 . The Investigating Officer, Sub-Inspector R.K. Chaudhary (PW6) carried the
investigation, recorded statements, prepared site plan (Ext. Ka-3), collected plain earth
as well as blood stained earth from the place of occurrence and after conducting inquest
at the hospital, sent the dead body for postmortem. The Accused Mukhtiar was arrested
on 29.3.1993 near village Bacchrota and from his possession one illegal pistol of 315
bore and one ammunition cartridge (Ext. K.13) were recovered. On 8th April, 1993 the
I.O. recorded the statements of other Accused Omal and Navin. A Tamancha, allegedly
used in the crime, was later recovered at the instance of Accused Ompal on 14.4.1993.
The statement of the wife of deceased (PW3) was recorded on 24.4.1993. After
concluding the investigation, the Judicial Magistrate, Hapur committed the case to the
Court of Sessions where charges were framed Under Section 302, Indian Penal Code
read with Section 34, Indian Penal Code against all the three Accused and additionally
charges were framed against Accused Mukhtiar Under Section 25 of the Arms Act. The
Accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
4 . At the trial, the prosecution mainly relied on the evidences of complainant--Naresh
Pal (PW1) and eyewitnesses Dharmendra (PW2) and Prakashee (PW3), wife of the
deceased. The motive for committing the crime was said to be that there was enmity
between the parties as about three years before the date of occurrence, Accused
Mukhtiar was shot at and in that regard a case was in progress at Hapur Court in which
Mahipal (PW1) was Accused. P.W. 4--Pratap Singh was examined as a witness to prove
the conspiracy. P.W. 5 is Dr. Hari Kishan Agarwal, who had conducted the post mortem
of deceased Mahipal. P.W. 6 S.I.R.K. Chaudhary--I.O. and P.W. 7-- Paltoo Ram, Head
Constable are the formal witness. At the end of the trial, the Trial Court came to the
conclusion that the prosecution has successfully proved the guilt of the Accused.
Accordingly, the Accused were convicted Under Section 302 read with 34, Indian Penal
Code and sentenced to suffer life imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/- each
and in default thereof, to further suffer six months rigorous imprisonment.
5 . The trial Court's judgment awarding conviction and sentence has been assailed by
the Accused by way of criminal appeal before the High Court. On appreciation of the
material placed before it, the High Court recorded its finding that the prosecution
witnesses, on whose evidence the trial Court has relied on, are not reliable.
Accordingly, the High Court set aside the judgment of the trial Court and acquitted all
the three Accused. Dissatisfied with the acquittal order passed by the High Court, the
State of Uttar Pradesh has preferred the present appeal before this Court.
6 . We have heard the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant and the
learned Amicus Curiae appearing on behalf of the Respondents.
7 . Learned Counsel for the State vehemently contended the impugned order and
submitted that the High Court has failed to appreciate the factum of presence of two
eyewitnesses PWs 2 and 3 at the spot, who deposed in clear terms the way in which the
Accused carried the assault on the deceased resulting in his death. The injuries on the
body of the deceased fully corroborates the prosecution case and the medical evidence
also supports the case of prosecution, but the High Court has, by setting aside the well
reasoned judgment rendered by the trial Court, committed a grave error of law calling
for this Court's interference.
8 . Learned Amicus Curiae, however, supported the view taken by the High Court and
submitted that there is no need for this Court to interfere with the order of acquittal
passed by the High Court.
9 . Having heard learned Counsel on either side, we have given our thoughtful
consideration to the facts and circumstances of the case in the light of material placed
before us. It appears that the trial Court based its judgment mainly relying upon the
evidences of three prosecution witness i.e. P.W. 1--Naresh Pal, the complainant, PW2--
Dharmendra, an eyewitness and PW3--Prakashee, another eyewitness and wife of the
deceased. However, in the view expressed by the High Court, the aforesaid witnesses
are not credible. Since the entire prosecution case hinges on the depositions of these
three witnesses, it is imperative for the Court to scrutinize their evidences properly so
as to sift the chaff from the grain and find out the truth. In that pursuit, their evidences
are to be considered from the point of view of credibility and trustworthiness. Once the
same stands satisfied, it ought to inspire confidence in the mind of the Court to accept
the stated evidence.
10. Admittedly, the complainant--PW1 has not witnessed the occurrence. He believed
whatever Dharmendra (PW2) informed him and accordingly he lodged the complaint. It
is also indisputable that PW1 was inimical with the Respondent party. There was also a
criminal case pending in Hapur Court relating to an incident of firing at the Accused, in
which the deceased as well as PW1 were Accused and Respondent No. 3 herein was the
victim. It is evident from the record that on the aspect of how PW1 came to know about
the incident, he made contradictory statements. There was no independent witness and
according to prosecution, despite the efforts made by police to record statements from
the public, no one was ready to give evidence. As per the statement of PW1, besides
PWs 2 & 3, two more persons Tej Pal and Ram Swaroop have also witnessed the
incident. It is quite unnatural that none of the eyewitnesses has lodged complaint, but
on the basis of information provided by Dharmendra (PW2), PW1 lodged the complaint
believing the version of Dharmendra.
11. On the other hand, the conduct and statements of PW2 (Dharmendra) who was
stated to be an eyewitness do not inspire confidence for the reason that his depositions
Under Section 161, Code of Criminal Procedure were quite different to what he stated
before Court in his examination-in-chief. He could not even give a satisfactory reason
for his presence at the time and place of occurrence. Furthermore, he did not choose to
lodge complaint with the police by himself even though he had witnessed the
occurrence as admittedly the complaint was lodged by PW1 on the information provided
by PW2. Apart from that, there were certain conflicting statements in his evidence as
regards how the deceased got injuries, and also his conduct of not making a hue and
cry and not disclosing to anyone about the occurrence on his way to the house of
Naresh Pal, gives rise to suspicion on the credibility and trustworthiness of PW2. When
the evidence of PW2 itself is unbelievable and jeopardizing the prosecution case, in no
manner the evidence of PW1 could be given credence.
12. We are also not inclined to believe the conduct of PW3-- wife of the deceased, who
was stated to be in a shock and not in consciousness for about a month after the death
of her husband. We find no valid documentary or medical evidence on record in support
of the claim of prosecution that PW3 was really in such unconscious state for about a
month. Looking at the unnatural behavior of eyewitnesses PWs 2 & 3 and their
contradictory statements, it cannot be said that their evidences are genuine so as to
convict the Accused.
1 3 . Also there were some notable flaws in the prosecution case which cannot be
ignored. According to PW4 (Pratap Singh), on the previous night of the incident, he
along with one Jakar (not examined) heard the Accused hatching conspiracy to murder
the deceased, but the prosecution did not present Jakar as a witness. It is incredible on
the part of PW4 that despite knowing about the conspiracy, he did not reveal it to the
victim party so as to save the life of the deceased. The trial Court also disbelieved his
evidence.
14. The High Court, while appreciating the evidence of the three important witnesses
i.e. PWs 1, 2 and 3, rightly disbelieved the presence of PWs 2 and 3 at the place of
occurrence and discredited the evidence of P.W. 1--complainant. Undoubtedly, the
prosecution in its effort to establish the case with the support of evidences of PWs 1, 2
and 3, has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt.
The High Court has, therefore, committed no illegality or manifest error in acquitting the
Accused giving them the benefit of doubt, under the circumstances. We express our
concurrence with the findings recorded by the High Court for acquitting the
Respondents. For the aforesaid reasoning, we do not find any merit in this appeal
calling for our interference Under Article 136 of the Constitution.

Trial Court convicted the Respondents. Aggrieved an appeal was preferred
wherein the High Court acquitted the Respondents. Hence, present appeal
was preferred.
Held, while dismissing appeal:
(i) The conduct and statements of second prosecution witness who was stated
to be an eyewitness did not inspire confidence for the reason that his
depositions were quite different to what he stated before Court in his
examination-in-chief. He could not even give a satisfactory reason for his
presence at the time and place of occurrence. Furthermore, he did not choose
to lodge complaint with the police by himself even though he had witnessed
the occurrence as admittedly the complaint was lodged by first prosecution
witness on the information provided by second prosecution witness. Apart
from that, there were certain conflicting statements in his evidence as
regards how the deceased got injuries, and also his conduct of not making a
hue and cry and not disclosing to anyone about the occurrence on his way to
the house, gives rise to suspicion on the credibility and trustworthiness of
second prosecution witness. [11 ]
(ii) The conduct of the wife of the deceased, who was stated to be in a shock
and not in consciousness for about a month after the death of her husband.
The present Court found no valid documentary or medical evidence on record
in support of the claim of prosecution that third prosecution witness was
really in such unconscious state for about a month. Looking at the unnatural
behavior of eyewitnesses and their contradictory statements, the present
Court was of the view that their evidences could not be considered genuine so
as to convict the Respondents. [12]

"Vikramajit Sen, J.
1. This Appeal assails the judgment of the learned Division Bench of the High Court of
Judicature at Bombay dated 22.3.2007, which allowed the writ petitions of the First and
Second Respondent herein. In this detailed and indeed lucid judgment it has been
clarified that the insurance policies issued by the Appellant ""are transferable and
assignable in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1938 and in terms of
the contract of life insurance.""
2 . The First Respondent is a company which is engaged, inter alia, in the business of
accepting and dealing in assignment of life insurance policies issued by the Appellant.
The Second Respondent is the Director and shareholder of the First Respondent. The
Third Respondent is a statutory authority established Under Section 3 of the Insurance
Regulatory & Development Authority Act, 1999, and is hereinafter referred to as IRDA.
The business of the First Respondent is to acquire life insurance policies from policy
holders by paying them consideration. The assigned policy is registered and recorded in
the books of the Appellant, and is then further assigned to a third party for
consideration. Upon registration in the books of the Appellant, it could then be further
assigned.
3 . In January 2003, several branches of the Appellant refused to accept notices of
assignment lodged by the First Respondent. A Circular was issued on 22.10.2003, the
content of which is reproduced below for facility of reference:
There have been reports in the Press recently of the existence of firms that are
in the business of buying of Insurance policies which are lapsed after acquiring
paid-up value, from the original policyholders by paying them an attractive sum
over and above the surrender value. The firm then becomes the assignee and is
entitled to all the rights of the policy be it maturity claim/death claim, etc.
The above practice if it becomes prevalent would not only undermine the real
purpose of life insurance but also allow third parties to make windfall gains by
such wagering contracts. Therefore, it is felt necessary to introduce measures to
safeguard the principles of life insurance and the larger interest of our
policyholders.
• If any Agent/employee is found to be involved in assisting such
Companies in respect of data acquisition of lapsed policies for revival
and subsequent assignment, strict action may be initiated against him.
• The Branch Offices would have to be more vigilant in case of revival
of policies that have been lapsed for longer duration say over 3 years.
In such cases, strict control on non-acceptance of third party cheques,
strict adherence to medical requirements, quality of medical
examination etc. would be required. Wherever it is clear that a TIP
company is involved, the revival may be outrightly rejected.
• If there are a number of assignments in the same Branch
Office/Divisional Office in favour of the same Financial Company, the
nature of the business of the Company may be investigated.
• If the Branch Office already has information that the nature of
business interest of the Financial Company is trading in insurance
policies only, the assignments in favour of such a Company may be
declined.
• Such policyholders may be educated through a specially designed
communication on the implications of ""absolute assignments"". This
may be done to safeguard the interest of those who may become
innocent victims of third parties indulging in this business.
The Branches may be instructed to start sending the data on absolute
assignment to the controlling Divisions cause-wise to keep a vigil on trading of
policies.
4 . The Appellant also stated in a letter to the First Respondent that assignments in
favour of companies who are only trading in insurances would not be permissible. The
various complaints by the First Respondent elicited a response by IRDA dated 3.3.3004,
in which it opined that the Appellant should register the assignments. The Appellant,
however, refused to do so, and instead issued another Circular dated 2.3.2005
reiterating the contents of the previous circular, and laying down a procedure for
""uniform implementation by all the offices of the Corporation"". A portion of this Circular
is reproduced, as it lays down the rationale behind the refusal to register these policies:
Life Insurance Policies, in general, are a measure of social security for the
family members of the life assured and in the absence of adequate savings or
securities, these Policies are often the only financial security available to the
family members of the deceased life assured. The Government of India has
guaranteed the Sum Assured with Bonus in all LIC Policies Under Section 37 of
the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956 to ensure the availability of financial
security to the family of the deceased.
In this connection, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Life Insurance
Corporation of India v. Consumer Education and Research Centre (reported in
MANU/SC/0772/1995 : AIR 1995 SC 1811) has ruled that the LIC discharges
important Constitutional functions and the Policies issued by it are a measure of
social security for the family of the life assured.
Between April 2002 to July 2003, our Offices at various places received several
Policies for registration of assignments in favour of some entities. Newspaper
articles also appeared in September 2003 about some Companies carrying on
trading in insurance Policies. The Corporation had to take urgent notice of such
a remarkable spurt in the registration of assignments in respect of such Policies
and the Corporation then noticed that these Policies were being purchased and
traded in like saleable securities of a stock market. It was also noticed by the
Corporation that the only purpose for which such assignment was being
obtained, was with a view to trading in them by further selling them, which
could continue indefinitely without reference to the life assured.
The Corporation had noticed that this process of trading, without any reference
to the life assured, is in the nature of speculation and weighing in as much as
none of the subsequent assignees would have either the means or the
inclination to find out whether the life assured was still alive. This, in turn,
would means that even if the life assured died a premature death, the Policies
would continue in circulation by means of such trading until its date of maturity
and the Corporation would then have to pay the final/ultimate assignee, the
entire maturity amount/value instead of the family members of the life assured,
benefiting there under and despite the fact that the death may have occurred
several years prior thereto.
Such trading in the Corporation' Policies offends the very essence of the Life
insurance contract and leaves the family of the life assured totally unprotected
in the event of death of the life assured. Hence, in order to prevent such
speculation and wagering which causes harm to millions of families all over
India, the Corporation has taken a policy decision to refuse the registration of
assignments which are in the nature of trading. For this purpose, the
Corporation has evolved a procedure to identify such transactions so as to
preserve and protect the interests of genuine policyholders of the Corporation,
and to leave untouched the genuine assignments by the life assured.
5. The First and Second Respondent before us filed a writ petition before the High Court
seeking a Declaration that the insurance policies issued by the Appellant are freely
tradable and assignable in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1938,
and that the Circulars dated 22.10.2003 and 2.3.2005 and the actions of the Appellant
in refusing to register the assignment of life insurance policies in favour of the First
Respondent are illegal, null and void.
6. The High Court, vide its impugned order, allowed the writ petition. It noted that life
insurance policies are the personal, movable property of the policy holder, and can be
said to be an actionable claim within the meaning of Section 3 of the Transfer of
Property Act. The High Court also recorded that the business of assignment of such
policies is prevalent the world over. While noting that this Court in LIC of India v.
Consumer Education and Research Centre MANU/SC/0772/1995 : (1995) 5 SCC 482 has
held that insurance is a social security measure, as was also reflected in the Statement
of Objects and Reasons of the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956 (LIC Act), the High
Court held that consequent to private entry into the business of life insurance it is no
longer possible to contend that life insurance remained a measure of social security. It
then went on to discuss the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States of
America in Basil P. Warnoc v. George Davis 104 US 771, wherein it was held that ""...in
all cases there must be reasonable ground, founded upon the relations of the parties to
each other, either pecuniary or of blood or affinity, to expect some benefit or advantage
from the continuance of the life of the assured. Otherwise the contract is a mere wager,
by which the party taking the policy is directly interested in the early death of the
assured. Such problems have a tendency to create a desire for the event. They are,
therefore, independently of any statute on the subject condemned as being against
public policy."" This decision came up for consideration before the U.S. Supreme Court
in Grigsby v. Russell 222 US 149. Grigsby did not agree with Warnoc, finding instead
that life insurance is a form of investment and savings, and to deny the right to sell it
would diminish its value. It was held that the rule of public policy that forbids the
taking out of insurance by one on the life of another in which he has no insurable
interest does not apply to the assignment by the insured of a valid policy to one not
having an insurable interest. In the impugned Judgment, the High Court noted that the
law in the U.S.A. after Grigsby is that though there has to be an insurable interest at the
inception when the policy is taken out, subsequent thereto there is no requirement of
insurable interest at the time of transfer or assignment. The argument raised by the
First and Second Respondent was that Section 38 of the Insurance Act is a substantive
right, whereas the Appellant contended that it is merely procedural. On an examination
of the Section and the manner in which it operates, it was held that once the insured
transfers or assigns the policy in favour of the assignee, the assignment is complete
between them. The insurer clearly has no choice or option in law but to accept the
transfer or assignment, provided the procedure laid down by Section 38 is followed.
The High Court therefore held that Section 38 is a substantive and not a procedural
provision. Section 38 makes it clear that the Legislature did not treat life insurance as a
security for protection of the widow or children of the life assured, but as a form of
investment and self-compelled saving. It is therefore desirable to impart to it all the
common characteristics of property. The Appellant is the only player in the market
which is refusing to accept such assignments. It was held that if the terms of the
contract between the Appellant and the insured barred assignment, the assignee would
also remain bound by this covenant. However, in the absence of any such contractual
term the Appellant cannot unilaterally vary the terms of the contract under the guise of
a policy decision, thereby endeavouring to disallow transfers that are legally valid Under
Section 38. As Section 38 is mandatory, it is not open to the Appellant to issue any
policy decision that is contrary to it. The Circulars dated 22.10.2003 and 2.3.2005 were
found to be illegal and it was held that insurance policies are transferable and
assignable.
7 . The question for us to decide is whether insurance policies are freely tradable and
assignable. To this end, it would be apposite to reproduce Section 38 of the Insurance
Act as it stood prior to its amendment in 2015:
38. Assignment and transfer of insurance policies.--(1) A transfer or
assignment of a policy of life insurance, whether with or without consideration
may be made only by an endorsement upon the policy itself or by a separate
instrument, signed in either case by the transferor or by the assignor, his duly
authorised agent and attested by at least one witness, specifically setting forth
the fact of transfer or assignment.
(2) The transfer or assignment shall be complete and effectual upon the
execution of such endorsement or instrument duly attested but except where
the transfer or assignment is in favour of the insurer shall not be operative as
against an insurer and shall not confer upon the transferee or assignee, or his
legal representative, and right to sue for the amount of such policy or the
moneys secured thereby until a notice in writing of the transfer or assignment
and either the said endorsement or instrument itself or a copy thereof certified
to be correct by both transferor and transferee or their duly authorised agents
have been delivered to the insurer:
Provided that where the insurer maintains one or more places of
business in India, such notice shall be delivered only at the place in
India mentioned in the policy for the purpose or at his principal place
of business in India.
(3) The date on which the notice referred to in Sub-section (2) is delivered to
the insurer shall regulate the priority of all claims under a transfer or
assignment as between persons interested in the policy; and where there is
more than one instrument of transfer or assignment the priority of the claims
under such instruments shall be governed by the order in which the notices
referred to in Sub-section (2) are delivered.
(4) Upon the receipt of the notice referred to in Sub-section (2), the insurer
shall record the fact of such transfer or assignment together with the date
thereof and the name of the transferee or the assignee and shall, on the request
of the person by whom the notice was given, or of the transferee or assignee,
on payment of a fee not exceeding one rupee, grant a written acknowledgement
of the receipt of such notice; and any such acknowledgement shall be
conclusive evidence against the insurer that he has duly received the notice to
which such acknowledgement relates.
(5) Subject to the terms and conditions of the transfer or assignment, the
insurer shall, from the date of receipt of the notice referred to in Sub-section
(2), recognise the transferee or assignee named in the notice as the only
person entitled to benefit under the policy, and such person shall be subject to
all liabilities and equities to which the transferor or assignor was subject at the
date of the transfer or assignment and may institute any proceedings in relation
to the policy without obtaining the consent of the transferor or assignor or
making him a party to such proceedings.
(6) Any rights and remedies of an assignee or transferee of a policy of life
insurance under an assignment or transfer effected prior to the commencement
of this Act shall not be affected by the provisions of this section.
(7) Notwithstanding any law or custom having the force of law to the contrary,
an assignment in favour of a person made with the condition that it shall be
inoperative or that the interest shall pass to some other person on the
happening of a specified event during the lifetime of the person whose life is
insured, and an assignment in favour of the survivor or survivors of a number
of persons, shall be valid.
This section has subsequently been amended by The Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act,
2015, and Section 38(2) now reads thus:
(2) The insurer may accept the transfer or assignment, or decline to act upon
any endorsement made Under Sub-section (1), where it has sufficient reason to
believe that such transfer or assignment is not bona fide or is not in the interest
of the policyholder or in public interest or is for the purpose of trading of
insurance policy.
This, along with the other changes introduced in the Section, indicates that the law as it
currently stands gives the Appellant a discretion as to whether or not to accept an
assignment provided its decision is predicated on the transfer or assignment being (a)
mala fide or (b) contrary to the interest of the policy holder or (c) against public
interest or (d) only for trading in the policy. The question before us, however, is limited
to the law as it stood prior to this statutory amendment.
8. The Appellant has contended that only certain first assignments, in which the policy
is a pledge or collateral for a loan, would be acceptable. Based on an undertaking to
this effect, we have disposed of Civil Appeal No. 8543 of 2009 which was being heard
along with this Civil Appeal. The Order dated 10.12.2015 passed by us reads thus:
The Affidavit filed on behalf of the Respondent No. 1 is taken on record.
Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant also submits that the
Undertakings may be accepted by the Court. The Undertakings furnished in the
said Affidavit are accepted by the Court. The affiant is cautioned that if any of
the Undertakings are breached, apart from any other consequences, the
Contempt of Courts would be attracted to the Respondent.
In view of the above, the Interim Orders passed on 4th April, 2008 are recalled.
The provisional registration shall be accorded permanence and/or full
registration. It is clarified that the Undertakings shall stand extended to any
fresh Applications for registration that may now be moved by the Respondents
for transactions, assignments and transfers effected prior to the Amendment of
Section 38, viz. with effect from 26th December, 2014; in other words, these
Applications shall be processed with expedition as per the unamended Section
38.
It is further clarified that in view of the disposal of this Appeal, in the
circumstances mentioned above, the Appellant will be liable to pay interest at
the prevailing Bank rate (without penal interest) as per Section 8 Subsection(
5) of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Protection
of Policy Holder Interest) Regulations, 2002. The disposal of this Appeal is
without prejudice to other Appeals in which arguments have been closed.
The Civil Appeal is disposed of with no Order as to costs.
The Appellant has argued that if multiple assignments are permitted the assignee will
not know if the insured has died, and trading in the policy may continue even after he
has. Furthermore, allowing parties in the position of the First Respondent to revive a
lapsed policy would amount to wagering. Regarding the prevailing law in other
jurisdictions, it has been submitted that the law in the U.S. is not based on Grigsby, as
the U.S. legal system it is a federal one. Even if Grigsby were taken as the prevailing
interpretation of the law, it does not state that all assignments must be accepted
regardless that they are in bad faith. The fact that the Government provides tax
deductions Under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961, that Life Insurance is not
liable to be attached and sold in execution of a decree Under Section 60 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, and that Life Insurance is guaranteed by the Central Government Under
Section 37 of the LIC Act indicates that it is a measure of social security, so the power
to refuse 'bad faith' assignments should be allowed on the grounds of public policy.
Finally, it has been argued once again that Section 38 is merely procedural, and the
substantive law is to be found and extrapolated from Common Law.
9. The First and Second Respondent, on the other hand, have contended that Section 38
recognises all assignments that comply with the requirements stated therein. Insurance
is intrinsically a matter of contract, and the Appellant cannot, by way of a Circular,
amend a contract and interfere with contractual rights and obligations. An insurable
interest is a precondition or essential element at the time of taking out the scheme but
not thereafter, including at the point of any reassignment. Section 38 is substantive, not
procedural, so there is no reason to advert to common law, as the Insurance Act was
passed well after the two American Supreme Court decisions alluded to above. Subsection
(9) of the post-amendment Section 38 was relied upon, which reads as follows:
(9) Any rights and remedies of an assignee or transferee of a policy of life
insurance under an assignment or transfer effected prior to the commencement
of the Insurance Law (Amendment) Act, 2015 shall not be affected by the
provisions of this section.
Thus this Sub-section protects the existing rights of the First Respondent. Even in the
absence of this Sub-section, Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 would have
come to the aid of these Respondents. It has also been alleged that the only reason that
the Appellant is averse to allowing re-assignment of policies is because it wants to
protect its own interests and repudiate its contractual liability.
10. It would be apposite for us to begin our analysis by discussing the operation of
Section 38 of the Insurance Act as it stood prior to its amendment. Section 38(1)
prescribed the procedure by which assignment were to be effected, namely, by way of
an endorsement or by means of a separate instrument. Sub-section (2) stated that once
a transfer or assignment was made in the manner prescribed by Sub-section (1), it was
complete and effectual. However, this transfer or assignment only became binding upon
written notice thereof being given by the transferor and transferee to the insurer. Subsection
(3) determined the priority of claims on the Insurance Policy by operation of
law. Sub-section (4) directed that upon receipt of the notice referred to in Sub-section
(2), the insurer became bound to record the transfer or assignment together with the
date thereof and the name of the transferee and the assignee; and if so requested grant
a written acknowledgment of the receipt of such notice. Sub-section (5) mandated the
insurer to recognise the transferee or assignee named in the notice as the only person
entitled to the benefit under the policy and such person would be subject to all
liabilities and equities. Sub-section (6) and (7) provided for some other contingencies
with which we are not immediately concerned.
1 1 . It is thus clear that on transfer or assignment of a policy and on the requisite
procedure being complied with, the assignee alone has an absolute interest in the
policy. The insurer was bound by the provisions of Section 38 to accept such a transfer
or endorsement. The only limitations placed on transferring a policy were in terms of
the procedure laid out in Section 38, and subject to the terms of policy itself. The
Section left no scope for the insurer to dispute the right to transfer or assign the policy.
Section 38 was thus clearly mandatory and substantive. The erstwhile Section 39(4)
also deserves reproduction in this vein, as it further indicated the mandatory character
of Section 38. It reads thus:
(4) A transfer or assignment of a policy made in accordance with Section 38
shall automatically cancel a nomination:
Provided that the assignment, of a policy to the insurer who bears the
risk on the policy at the time of the assignment, in consideration of a
loan granted by that insurer on the security of the policy within its
surrender value, or its reassignment on repayment of the loan shall not
cancel a nomination, but shall affect the rights of the nominee only to
the extent of the insurer's interest in the policy.
12. The Appellant has argued that Section 38 could result in scenarios where it was
bound to accept fraudulent policies since it had not been bestowed with discretionary
powers. We do not find any content in this contention, for the reason that in cases of
fraud, the assignment could be challenged on that ground even after being recorded.
Furthermore, when the Appellant encountered a fraud inter alia in reviving lapsed
policies, such as in cases of reviving the policy of an insured who is already deceased,
it could refuse to recognize the revival, which it is well within its rights to do as a
contractual clause to this effect forms part of the policy.
1 3 . The amendment to the Insurance Act by the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act,
2015, is significant. As previously discussed, Section 38 as it now stands gives the
insurer the discretion to decide whether or not to accept a transfer or assignment of an
Insurance Policy. The Amendment Act, according to its Statement of Objects and
Reasons, is ""An Act further to amend the Insurance Act, 1938 and the General Insurance
Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972 and to amend the Insurance Regulatory and
Development Authority Act, 1999."" It is thus neither a declaratory or clarificatory piece
of legislation. The language of the extant Section 38 cannot be interpreted to mean that
this is what Section 38 had meant all along. Furthermore, had the Legislature intended
to amend Section 38 retrospectively, it would have said so explicitly. Instead, it has
incorporated Sub-section (9), which protects rights and remedies of assignees that
arose prior to the commencement of the Amendment Act. It is thus clear that Parliament
intended to allow all previous assignments and transfers provided that they complied
with the requirements laid out in Section 38. In the face of this clear legislative intent,
no other interpretation of Section 38 is possible. It is accordingly not incumbent for us
to discuss whether insurance policies partake of the nature of social security, or
whether the transfer of such policies tantamount to wagering contracts.
14. In our considered opinion it is not open to the Appellants to charter a course which
is different to the postulation in the Insurance Act, by means of its own Circulars. We
need not go beyond mentioning the decision of this Court in Avinder Singh v. State of
Punjab MANU/SC/0299/1978 : (1979) 1 SCC 137 wherein it has been held that the
Legislature cannot efface itself by delegating its plenary powers unless the delegate
functions strictly under its supervision. If the delegate is allowed to function
independently it would tantamount to ""usurpation of legislative power itself."" This view
came to be reiterated to decades later in Agricultural Market Committee v. Shalimar
Chemical Works Ltd. MANU/SC/0644/1997 : (1997) 5 SCC 516. This Court held that
""....... Power to make subsidiary legislation may be entrusted by the legislature to
another body of its choice but the legislature should, before delegating, enunciate either
expressly or by implication, the policy and the principles for the guidance of the
delegates"". The position that obtains today is diametrically opposite inasmuch as the
statute permitted, at the relevant time, the assignment and/or transfer of life insurance
policies, but the delegate, through its Circulars, has attempted to nullify that provision
of law. We conclude, therefore, that the circulars are ultra vires the Statute and must
therefore be made ineffectual.
15. We also think that it is not appropriate to import the principles of public policy,
which are always imprecise, difficult to define, and akin to an unruly horse, into
contractual matters. The contra proferentem rule is extremely relevant inasmuch as it is
the Appellant who has drafted the insurance policy and was therefore well-positioned to
include clauses making it specifically impermissible to assign policies. In the absence of
any such covenant, the Appellant cannot be heard to say that such transfers or
assignments violate public policy. In any event, as we have seen above, the general
global practice is to permit assignments of insurance policies.
16. It is for these manifold reasons and in view of the analysis of the law prior to as
well as post the amendments carried out in the Insurance Act that we find the Appeal to
be devoid of merits. The impugned judgment is well-reasoned and takes within its
sweep all the relevant documents raised. The Appeal is accordingly dismissed.","Appellants:LIC of India

Facts
First Respondent is a company engaged in the business of accepting and
dealing in assignment of life insurance policies issued by Appellant. First
Respondent acquired life insurance policies from policy holders by paying
them consideration. Assigned policy was registered and recorded in
Appellant's books, subsequently being assigned to a third party for
consideration. Upon registration in the books of the Appellant, it could then
be further assigned. In January 2003, several branches of Appellant refused
to accept notices of assignment lodged by First Respondent. A Circular was
issued on 22.10.2003 introducing measures concerning the practice of buying
lapsed insurance policies, allowing third-parties to make windfall gains by
wagering such contracts. Appellant also stated in a letter to the First
Respondent that assignments in favour of companies who are only trading in
insurances would not be permissible. On 2.3.2005 Appellant issued another
Circular reiterating the contents of previous circular, and laying down a
procedure for ""uniform implementation by all the offices of the Corporation"".
First Respondent petitioned High Court seeking a declaration that insurance
policies issued by Appellant are freely tradable and assignable in accordance
with the provisions of the Act and Circulars dated 22.10.2003 and 2.3.2005
were illegal. High Court allowed the petition, making the following
observations: life insurance policies were personal, movable property of the
policy holder, and can be said to be an actionable claim within the meaning of
Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act; consequent to private entry into
business of life insurance it could not be contended that life insurance was a
measure of social security; law in the United States of America was though
there has to be an insurable interest at inception when policy is taken out,
subsequently there was no requirement of insurable interest at the time of
transfer or assignment. Circulars dated 22.10.2003 and 2.3.2005 were held
illegal, and insurance policies were determined to be transferable and
assignable. Hence, the present appeal.
Held, dismissing the appeal
1. From unamended Section 38(1) of the Act it emerged that on transfer or
assignment of a policy and on requisite procedure being complied with,
assignee alone has an absolute interest in the policy. Insurer was bound by
provisions of Section 38 of the Act, which was mandatory and substantive, to
accept such a transfer or endorsement. Section 38 was thus clearly mandatory
and substantive. Pursuant to Amendment Act,2015, Section 38 allows insurer
the discretion to decide whether or not to accept a transfer or assignment of
an insurance policy. Amendment Act, 2015 is neither declaratory nor
clarificatory; if it was intended to be retrospective, it would have stated
explicitly. Instead, Section 38(9) protects rights and remedies of assignees
that arose prior to commencement of the Amendment Act, 2015.[11] and[13]
2. In cases of fraud, assignment could be challenged on that ground even
after being recorded; alternatively, it could refuse to recognize revival, which
it could within its contractual rights. However, it is not open to Appellants to
charter a course different to one postulated in the Act by means of its own
Circulars. It was inappropriate for Appellant to attempt import of public policy
principles, which are imprecise and difficult to define into contractually
defined matters. It is Appellant that drafted the insurance policy and was
well-positioned to include clauses making it specifically impermissible to
assign policies. In the absence of any such covenant, the Appellant cannot
claim that such transfers or assignments violate public policy. Contrarily, the
general global practice is to permit assignments of insurance policies.[12],

1. The Appellant-complainant filed a batch of 21 complaints i.e. C.D. Nos. 539 to 559 of
2000, claiming compensation of Rs. 43.59 lacs along with interest @ 18% p.a. from the
Respondents, namely, United India Insurance Company Limited and India Transport

Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL). The case of the complainant before
the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Ranga Reddy District (for short, 'the District

packed in wooden drums were delivered at stores of PGCIL at Assam. In all the trucks
shortage was noticed by PGCIL on 25th March, 1998. As there was shortage, which is
called transit-loss for which the Appellant had taken a policy from the insurer, it put
forth a claim before the insurer for Rs. 35 lacs. The said claim was lodged before the
insurance company vide letter dated 3rd April, 1998.
2 . On the basis of the communication made by the Appellant, the insurer appointed a
surveyor who gave a report on 1st September, 1998, assessing the loss approximately
at Rs. 2 lacs in each case, thereby the amount in toto assessed by the surveyor was
approximately Rs. 43 lacs. Though the surveyor had assessed the loss and sent it to the
insurance company, the insurer vide letter dated 20th September, 1999, repudiated the
claim by stating thus:
Dear Sirs,
Re: Marine
Claim No. 050202/21/26/7/18/97/
Policy No. 050202/21/26/16/2101/97
On perusal of the records pertaining to the above claim, and subsequent
investigation into the matter, we find that the above claim lodged by you does
not fall under the purview of ""TRANSIT LOSS"". As such, the claim is not tenable
under the terms of the policy. In view of this, we are treating your above claim
as ""NO CLAIM"".
[Emphasis added]
3 . As the claim was not accepted, the Appellant knocked at the doors of the District
Forum for grant of compensation, but the District Forum declined to accept the claim on
three counts, namely, that there was non-joinder of necessary parties; that the
allegation of theft was not proved; and that in a summary proceeding the factual
dispute could not be decided.
4 . Dissatisfied by the order passed by the District Forum, the Appellant preferred
twenty-one appeals before the Andhra Pradesh Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission (for short, 'the State Commission'). The State Commission after analysing
the materials brought on record opined that the investigator could not be relied upon as
the investigation had been completed after six months from the date of occurrence; that
the report of the investigator could not be said to have been based on any material
worthy of verification; that since it was the carrier who had undertaken to deliver the
goods at Assam, it was they who are responsible to give reasons as to how, when and
where the goods were transshipped and in what condition the goods were delivered;
that the length and net weight of AAAC wire was mentioned on each drum and also
dispatch documents and the Respondent No. 2, that is, the carrier company had issued
Exhibit A-3 (lorry receipts) wherein cross reference to the invoice and delivery challan
numbers were given which clearly established the fact that the complainant had
dispatched as per the said Exhibit; that since the persons present at the site at the
relevant point of time i.e. unloading, were the drivers, there was no reason to
disbelieve their endorsements, specifically when the documents, viz., Exhibits A-25 and
27 confirm the shortage on 25.04.1998 in 109 drums; that the finding of the District
Forum that the complaint was not maintainable due to non-joinder of necessary party,
that is, PGCIL, was not correct and the complaint could not have been dismissed on that
score; that the report of the surveyor, that is, Exhibit A-12 was based on physical
verification of the consignment of AAAC wire and hence, the repudiation of claim by the
insurer was unjustified; and that there was no inordinate delay in intimating the claim
to the insurance company. Being of this view, the State Commission allowed the
appeals preferred by the Appellant and determined the compensation approximately at
Rs. 43 lacs in all the appeals. Be it noted, the State Commission while determining the
quantum, made the insurer and the carrier jointly and severely liable.
5. The judgment and order passed by the State Commission compelled the insurer and
the carrier to file independent revisions before the National Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission, New Delhi (for short, 'the National Commission). The revisions
preferred by the carrier stood dismissed and the same have not been challenged and,
therefore, the view expressed in the case of the carrier has attained finality.
6 . As far as the insurer is concerned, it preferred twenty-one revisions, out of which
four were dismissed by the National Commission vide judgment and order dated 6th
March, 2009, on the foundation that as they dealt with the transactions pertaining to
""open delivery"". We are not concerned with those four revisions. As far as the
seventeen revision are concerned, the National Commission allowed them on the ground
that the intimation by the complainant to the insurer was not made within seven days of
arrival of the vehicles at the destination mentioned in the policy. The reasoning of the
National Commission is to the following effect:
In this regard, the dates of delivery are important to us. As per material
brought on record, the first intimation of the claim or loss was reported to the
Petitioner insurer only on 27.3.1998 and confirmed by letter dated 3.4.98.
There is no dispute that the arrival dates of the different consignments in
question start from 1.3.98 onwards till 11.4.98. In the above circumstances and
keeping in view the terms of the Policy, condition 5 of Inland Transit Clause, we
are of the view that there was no Policy Cover in existence and the risk stood
not covered after delivery of goods to the consignee. We further note that, even
on practical side, not reporting the loss in time deprived the Insurer to have a
first a first hand appreciation/assessment of the extent of loss, more so when,
as per statement on record, against number of consignments/delivery notes it is
clearly noted 'seal tempered'.
There can be no dispute that Insurance is a contract of utmost good faith.
Failing to report the loss, noted at the time of receipt/delivery is a decisive and
a determinate factor against the complainant. We also note with some dismay,
and wonder as to why PGCIL was not made a party as it was at their warehouse
in Assam that shortage/loss is alleged to have been notice. It is stated by the
Ld. Counsel of the Petitioner that an effort was made before the State
Commission praying for making PGCIL a party but it was declined. The whole
episode leaves us with a single thought that complainant did not care for the
terms of the contract and went on to compound the wrongs.
In retrospect one could only observe that at least in cases/consignment where
material was found tempered, matter should have been reported to the
underwriters immediately and delivery should not have been made by the
complainant to the consignee till the loss had been assessed by the surveyor
after perhaps asking for an open-delivery. This could have been the case of the
consignee also - not making him a party should be held against the
complainant.
In the aforementioned circumstances, we are of the view that there was no
coverage of risk at the time of reporting the loss to the Petitioner/insurer, hence
the complainant is not entitled to any relief in terms of condition(s) of Policy as
also law and other material on the subject discussed earlier and also the law
laid down by this Commission in the cited judgment (supra).
7 . Being of this view, the National Commission allowed the revision petitions and set
aside the orders passed by the State Commission.
8. We have heard Mr. Rana Mukherjee, learned senior Counsel for the Appellant and Mr.
Rakesh Kumar, learned Counsel for the Respondent No. 2. None has appeared on behalf
of the Respondent No. 1, the insurer.
9 . It is submitted by Mr. Rana Mukherjee, learned senior Counsel that the National
Commission has grossly erred by opining that the PGCIL is a necessary party. It is his
further submission that the view expressed by the National Commission that the claim
stands defeated because of delayed intimation as postulated in Clause No. 5, of the
policy is not sustainable, inasmuch as a survey was conducted and that apart the letter
of repudiation does not refer or even remotely touch upon any of the aspects
enumerated in Clause 5. Additionally, it is urged by Mr. Mukherjee, learned senior
Counsel that the National Commission has erroneously held that the complainant went
on compounding the wrongs, whereas the material brought on record clearly establish
that it was quite vigilant and diligent in putting forth his claim and, in fact, its conduct
shows intrinsic faith in the insurer.
10. Mr. Rakesh Kumar, learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent No. 2 made an
endeavour to support the order passed by the National Commission, but, as has been
stated earlier, when the revisions preferred by the carrier have already been dismissed
and the said orders have attained finality having not been assailed, we do not think he
can be permitted to argue to sustain the order passed by the National Commission. Be
that as it may, it really does not make any difference.
11. Clause 5 of the Policy that relates to ""Duration"", reads as follows:
5 . Duration-. This insurance attaches from the goods leave the warehouse
and/or the store at the placed name in the policy for the commencement of
transit and continues during the ordinary course of transit including customary
transhipment if any,
(i) until delivery to the final warehouse at the destination named in the
(ii) in respect of transit by Rail only or Rail and Road, until expiry of 7
days after arrival of the railway wagon at the final destination railway
station or
(iii) in respect of transit by Road only until expiry of 7 days after arrival
of the vehicle at the destination town named in the policy whichever
shall first occur.
N.B. 1. The period of 7 days referred to above shall reckoned from the midnight
of the day of arrival of railway wagon at the destination railway station or
2 . Transit by Rail only shall incidental transit by Road performed by Railway
Authorities to or from Railway Out-Agency.
12. The National Commission has relied upon Clause 5 and on that basis has rejected
the claim by putting the blame on the complainant. The letter of repudiation dated 20th
September, 1999, which we have reproduced hereinbefore, interestingly, does not
whisper a single word with regard to delay or, in fact, does not refer at all to the
duration clause. What has been stated in the letter of repudiation is that the claim
lodged by the complainant does not fall under the purview of transit-loss because of the
subsequent investigation report. It is evincible, the insurer had taken cognizance of the
communication made by the Appellant and nominated a surveyor to verify the loss.
Once the said exercise has been undertaken, we are disposed to think that the insurer
could not have been allowed to take a stand that the claim is hit by the Clause
pertaining to duration.
In the absence of any mention in the letter of repudiation and also from the conduct of
the insurer in appointing a surveyor, it can safely be concluded that the insurer had
waived the right which was in its favour under the duration clause. In this regard, Mr.
Mukherjee, learned senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant has commended us to a
decision of High Court of Delhi in Krishna Wanti v. Life Insurance Corporation of
India 2000 (52) DRJ (DB), wherein the High Court has taken note of the fact that if the
letter of repudiation did not mention an aspect, the same could not be taken as a stand
when the matter is decided. We approve the said view.
13. In this context, we may with profit, reproduce a passage from Halsbury Law of
England, which reads as follows:
In Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 16(2), 4th Edn., Para 907, it is stated:
The expression 'waiver' may, in law, bear different meanings. The
primary meaning has been said to be the abandonment of a right in
such a way that the other party is entitled to plead the abandonment by
way of confession and avoidance if the right is thereafter asserted, and
is either express or implied from conduct. It may arise from a party
making an election, for example whether or not to exercise a
contractual right... Waiver may also be by virtue of equitable or
promissory estoppel; unlike waiver arising from an election, no
question arises of any particular knowledge on the part of the person
making the representation, and the estoppel may be suspensory only...
Where the waiver is not express, it may be implied from conduct which
is inconsistent with the continuance of the right, without the need for
writing or for consideration moving from, or detriment to, the party
who benefits by the waiver, but mere acts of indulgence will not
amount to waiver; nor may a party benefit from the waiver unless he
has altered his position in reliance on it.
14. I n Manak Lal v. Dr. Prem Chand Singhvi MANU/SC/0001/1957 : AIR 1957 SC
425, it has been held:
8. ... It is true that waiver cannot always and in every case be inferred merely
from the failure of the party to take the objection. Waiver can be inferred only if
and after it is shown that the party knew about the relevant facts and was
aware of his right to take the objection in question. As Sir John Romilly, M.R.
has observed in Vyvyan v. Vyvyan (1861) 30 Beav 65 : 54 ER 813: (Beav p.
75: ER p. 817)
Waiver or acquiescence, like election, presupposes that the person to
be bound is fully cognizant of his rights, and that being so, he neglects
to enforce them, or chooses one benefit instead of another, either, but
not both, of which he might claim.
15. Yet again, in Krishna Bahadur v. Purna Theatre MANU/SC/0667/2004 : (2004)
8 SCC 229, it has been ruled that:
A right can be waived by the party for whose benefit certain requirements or
conditions had been provided for by a statute subject to the condition that no
public interest is involved therein. Whenever waiver is pleaded it is for the party
pleading the same to show that an agreement waiving the right in consideration
of some compromise came into being. Statutory right, however, may also be
waived by his conduct.
1 6 . I n State of Punjab v. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar MANU/SC/1476/2011 :
(2011) 14 SCC 770, a two-Judge Bench speaking about the waiver has opined:
41. Waiver is an intentional relinquishment of a right. It involves conscious
abandonment of an existing legal right, advantage, benefit, claim or privilege,
which except for such a waiver, a party could have enjoyed. In fact, it is an
agreement not to assert a right. There can be no waiver unless the person who
is said to have waived, is fully informed as to his rights and with full knowledge
about the same, he intentionally abandons them. (Vide Dawsons Bank Ltd. v.
Nippon Menkwa Kabushiki Kaisha MANU/PR/0024/1935 : AIR 1935 PC 79,

Purna Theatre.)
4 2 . This Court in Municipal Corpn. of Greater Bombay v. Dr Hakimwadi
Tenants' Assn. 1988 Supp SCC 55 considered the issue of waiver/acquiescence
by the non-parties to the proceedings and held: (SCC p. 65, paras 14-15)
14. In order to constitute waiver, there must be voluntary and
intentional relinquish-ment of a right. The essence of a waiver is an
estoppel and where there is no estoppel, there is no waiver. Estoppel
and waiver are questions of conduct and must necessarily be
determined on the facts of each case. ...
15. There is no question of estoppel, waiver or abandonment. There is
no specific plea of waiver, acquiescence or estoppel, much less a plea
of abandonment of right. That apart, the question of waiver really does
not arise in the case. Admittedly, the tenants were not parties to the
earlier proceedings. There is, therefore, no question of waiver of rights
by Respondents 4-7 nor would this disentitle the tenants from
maintaining the writ petition.
17. In the instant case, the insurer was in custody of the policy. It had prescribed the
Clause relating to duration. It was very much aware about the stipulation made in
Clause 5(3) to 5(5), but despite the stipulations therein, it appointed a surveyor.
Additionally, as has been stated earlier, in the letter of repudiation, it only stated that
the claim lodged by the insured was not falling under the purview of transit loss. Thus,
by positive action, the insurer has waived its right to advance the plea that the claim
was not entertainable because conditions enumerated in duration Clause were not
satisfied. In our considered opinion, the National Commission could not have placed
reliance on the said terms to come to the conclusion that there was no policy cover in
existence and that the risks stood not covered after delivery of goods to the consignee.
18. Coming to the merits of the claim, we find that the surveyor had given a report that
there was a loss. He had also quantified it. The State Commission after elaborate
discussion has held as follows:
The surveyor also confirmed in their reports, the shortage/loss of AAAC due to
pilferage during transit and estimated the loss as per Ex. A12. This shortage
was also confirmed by Katigorah police as per Ex. A13 and as reiterated earlier
by the Tage Over Certificate, Ex. A19. Taking into consideration that the
surveyors appointed by the insurance company have completed their
investigation and submitted their reports and thereafter an investigator was
appointed on 16-4-1998 without any valid reasons. It is held by the National
Commission in 1 (2004) CPJ 10 (NC) in Gammon India Ltd. v. New India
Assurance Co. Ltd. that 'Report of first surveyor not accepted, second surveyor
appointed-Appointment of second surveyor not explained - Deficiency in service
proved - Report of first surveyor upheld' and the investigator in the instant case
submitted his report on 28-12-1998 i.e. almost 8 months after his appointment.
Taking into consideration all the above submissions, we are of the considered
opinion that the Appellant/complainant was able to establish that there was
shortage/damage to the consignment which was given to second Respondent
for transportation.
19. Though the said aspect has not been gone into by the National Commission, yet we
find, the findings recorded by the State Commission are absolutely justified and tenable
in law being based on materials brought on record in such a situation we do not think it
appropriate that an exercise of remit should be carried out asking the National
Commission to have a further look at it. In any case, the exercise of revisional
jurisdiction by the National Commission is a limited one. We may hasten to add that to
satisfy ourselves, we have perused the surveyor's report and scrutinized the judgment
and order passed by the State Commission in this regard and we are completely
satisfied that the determination made by it is absolutely impeccable.
20. In view of the aforesaid analysis, the appeals are allowed. The judgment and order
passed by the National Commission in the batch of appeals is set aside. We have been
apprised that 50% of the amount was deposited and the Appellant has withdrawn the
said amount. The balance amount along with interest, as directed by the State
Commission, shall be paid by the insurance company within four months from today.
There shall be no order as to costs.","Appellants: Galada Power and Telecommunication Ltd.

For Respondents/Defendant: Rakesh Kumar, Arun Kumar, Bipin Kumar Jha, Prabhat

Facts:
The Appellant-complainant filed a batch of 21 complaints claiming
compensation of Rs. 43.59 lacs along with interest @ 18% p.a. from the
Respondents, namely, United India Insurance Company Limited and India
Transport Organization, on the ground that there had been shortage/loss of
'All Aluminium Alloy Conductor' (AAAC) wire, which was supplied by the
complainant to the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL). The case
of the complainant before the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Ranga
Reddy District (the District Forum) was that between 1.3.1998 to 13.4.1998,
twenty-one trucks of AAAC wire packed in wooden drums were delivered at
stores of PGCIL at Assam. In all the trucks shortage was noticed by PGCIL on
25th March, 1998. As there was shortage, which is called transit-loss for
which the Appellant had taken a policy from the insurer, it put forth a claim
before the insurer for Rs. 35 lacs. The said claim was lodged before the
insurance company vide letter dated 3rd April, 1998.
On the basis of the communication made by the Appellant, the insurer
appointed a surveyor who gave a report assessing the loss approximately at
Rs. 2 lacs in each case, thereby the amount in toto assessed by the surveyor
was approximately Rs. 43 lacs. Though the surveyor had assessed the loss
and sent it to the insurance company, the insurer repudiated the claim on the
ground that the claim lodged by the Appellant did not fall under the purview
of ""Transit loss"".
As the claim was not accepted, the Appellant approached the District Forum
for grant of compensation, but the District Forum declined to accept the claim
on three counts, namely, that there was non-joinder of necessary parties;
that the allegation of theft was not proved; and that in a summary proceeding
the factual dispute could not be decided.
Dissatisfied, the Appellant preferred twenty-one appeals before the Andhra
Pradesh Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (the State Commission).
The State Commission allowed the appeals preferred by the Appellant and
determined the compensation approximately at Rs. 43 lacs in all the appeals.
The State Commission while determining the quantum, made the insurer and
the carrier jointly and severally liable.
The insurer and the carrier filed independent revisions before the National
Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, New Delhi (the National
Commission). The revisions preferred by the carrier stood dismissed and the
same have not been challenged and, therefore, the view expressed in the
case of the carrier has attained finality.
The insurer preferred twenty-one revisions, out of which four were dismissed
by the National Commission. The Court is not concerned with those four
revisions. As far as the seventeen revision are concerned, the National
Commission allowed them on the ground that the intimation by the
complainant to the insurer was not made within seven days of arrival of the
vehicles at the destination mentioned in the policy.
The National Commission, thus, allowed the revision petitions and set aside
the orders passed by the State Commission.
Held, while allowing the appeals
Mr. Rakesh Kumar, learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent No. 2 made
an endeavour to support the order passed by the National Commission, but, as
has been stated earlier, when the revisions preferred by the carrier have
already been dismissed and the said orders have attained finality having not
been assailed, the Court did not think that he can be permitted to argue to
sustain the order passed by the National Commission. Be that as it may, it
really does not make any difference.[10]
The National Commission has relied upon Clause 5 and on that basis has
rejected the claim by putting the blame on the complainant. The letter of
repudiation dated 20th September, 1999, interestingly, does not whisper a
single word with regard to delay or, in fact, does not refer at all to the

which was in its favour under the duration clause. In this regard, Mr.
Mukherjee, learned senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant had
commended the Court to a decision of High Court of Delhi in Krishna Wanti v.
Life Insurance Corporation of India , wherein the High Court has taken note
of the fact that if the letter of repudiation did not mention an aspect, the

"Ranjan Gogoi, J.
1. Unable to agree with the reasoning and the conclusion of a two judge bench of this
Court in National Insurance Co. Limited v. Sinitha and Ors. [MANU/SC/1374/2011 :
(2012) 2 SCC 356] a coordinate bench of this Court by order dated 29th October, 2013
has referred the instant matter for a resolution of what appears to be the following
question of law.
Whether in a claim proceeding Under Section 163 A of the Motor Vehicles Act,
1988 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Act"") it is open for the Insurer to raise the
defence/plea of negligence?
2. A second question as to what would be the true scope and meaning of the provisions
contained in Section 170 of the Act more specifically as set out in Queries (iii) to (v) in
paragraph 10 of the report of United India Insurance Co. Limited v. Shila Datta and Ors.
[MANU/SC/1256/2011 : (2011) 10 SCC 509], also arises. However, the aforesaid
Question stands referred to a Larger Bench in Shila Datta (supra) itself. We are told that
answers to the questions referred are awaited. In view of the above, we would be
required to answer only the first question arising in the reference which has been set
out herein above.
3 . I n Sinitha's case (supra), a two judge bench of this Court understood the scope of
Section 163A of the Act to be enabling an Insurer to raise the defence of negligence to
counter a claim for compensation. The principal basis on which the conclusion in
Sinitha's case (supra) was reached and recorded is the absence of a provision similar to
Sub-section (4) of Section 140 of the Act in Section 163A of the Act. Such absence has
been understood by the Bench to be a manifestation of a clear legislative intention that
unlike in a proceeding Under Section 140 of the Act where the defence of the Insurer
based on negligence is shut out, the same is not be the position in a proceeding Under
Section 163A of the Act.
4. We have considered the matter and have heard the learned Counsels for the parties.
5 . I n Deepal Girishbhai Soni and Ors. v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd., Baroda
[MANU/SC/0246/2004 : (2004) 5 SCC 385] the issue before a three judge bench of this
Court was with regard to the mutual exclusiveness of the provisions of Section 163A
and Section 166 of the Act. While dealing with the said question, this Court had the
occasion to go into the reasons and objects for the incorporation of Section 140 and
163A of the Act which came in by subsequent amendments, details of which are being
noted separately herein below. The Bench also took the view that while Section 140 of
the Act deals with cases of interim compensation leaving it open for the claimant to
agitate for final compensation by resort to the provisions of Section 166 of the Act,
Section 163A of the Act provides for award of final compensation on a structured
formula following the provisions of Second Schedule appended to the Act. Both
Sections i.e. Sections 140 and 163A are based on the concept of 'no fault liability' and
have been enacted as measures of social security. It was further noted that in a
proceeding Under Section 163A of the Act the Tribunal may be required to adjudicate
upon various disputed questions like age, income, etc. unlike in a proceeding Under
Section 140 of the Act.
6 . Deepal Girishbhai Soni's case (supra), in fact, arose out of a reference made for a
decision on the correctness of the view expressed in Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v.
Hansrajbhai V. Kodala and Ors. [MANU/SC/0235/2001 : (2001) 5 SCC 175 that
determination of compensation in a proceeding Under Section 163A of the Act is final
and further proceedings Under Section 166 of the Act is barred. The opinion rendered in
Hansrajbhai V. Kodala (supra) contains an elaborate recapitulation of the reasons
behind the enactment of Section 92A to 92E of the Old Act (i.e. Motor Vehicles Act,
1939) (corresponding to Sections 140 to 144 of the present Act) introducing for the first
time the concept of 'no fault liability' in departure from the usual common law principle
that a claimant should establish negligence on the part of the owner or driver of the
motor vehicle before claiming any compensation for death or permanent disablement
caused on account of a motor vehicle accident. In the said report, there is a reference to
the deliberations of the Committee constituted to review the provisions of the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988 and the suggestions of the Transport Development Council on the
basis of which the draft Bill of 1994 was enacted, inter alia, to provide for:
(h) increase in the amount of compensation to the victims of hit-and-run cases;
(k) a new predetermined formula for payment of compensation to road accident
victims on the basis of age/income, which is more liberal and rational.
7 . As observed in Hansrajbhai V. Kodala (supra) one of the suggestions made by the
Transport Development Council was ""to provide adequate compensation to victims of
road accidents without going into long drawn procedure."" As a sequel to the
recommendations made by the Committee and the Council, Section 140 was enacted in
the present Act in place of Section 92A to 92E of the Old Act. Compensation payable
thereunder, as under the repealed provisions, continued to be on the basis of no fault
liability though at an enhanced rate which was further enhanced by subsequent
amendments. Sections 140 and 141 of the present Act makes it clear that compensation
payable thereunder does not foreclose the liability to pay or the right to receive
compensation under any other provision of the Act or any other law in force except
compensation awarded Under Section 163A of the Act. Compensation Under Section 140
of the Act was thus understood to be in the nature of an interim payment pending the
final award Under Section 166 of the Act. Section 163-A, on the other hand, was
introduced in the New Act for the first time to remedy the situation where determination
of final compensation on fault basis Under Section 166 of the Act was progressively
getting protracted. The Legislative intent and purpose was to provide for payment of
final compensation to a class of claimants (whose income was below Rs. 40,000/- per
annum) on the basis of a structured formula without any reference to fault liability. In
fact, in Hansrajbhai V. Kodala (supra) the bench had occasion to observe that:
Compensation amount is paid without pleading or proof of fault, on the
principle of social justice as a social security measure because of everincreasing
motor vehicle accidents in a fast-moving society. Further, the law
before insertion of Section 163-A was giving limited benefit to the extent
provided Under Section 140 for no-fault liability and determination of
compensation amount on fault liability was taking a long time. That mischief is
sought to be remedied by introducing Section 163-A and the disease of delay is
sought to be cured to a large extent by affording benefit to the victims on
structured-formula basis. Further, if the question of determining compensation
on fault liability is kept alive it would result in additional litigation and
complications in case claimants fail to establish liability of the owner of the
defaulting vehicles.
8. From the above discussion, it is clear that grant of compensation Under Section 163-
A of the Act on the basis of the structured formula is in the nature of a final award and
the adjudication thereunder is required to be made without any requirement of any
proof of negligence of the driver/owner of the vehicle(s) involved in the accident. This
is made explicit by Section 163A(2). Though the aforesaid Section of the Act does not
specifically exclude a possible defence of the Insurer based on the negligence of the
claimant as contemplated by Section 140(4), to permit such defence to be introduced by
the Insurer and/or to understand the provisions of Section 163A of the Act to be
contemplating any such situation would go contrary to the very legislative object behind
introduction of Section 163A of the Act, namely, final compensation within a limited
time frame on the basis of the structured formula to overcome situations where the
claims of compensation on the basis of fault liability was taking an unduly long time. In
fact, to understand Section 163A of the Act to permit the Insurer to raise the defence of
negligence would be to bring a proceeding Under Section 163A of the Act at par with
the proceeding Under Section 166 of the Act which would not only be self-contradictory
but also defeat the very legislative intention.
9 . For the aforesaid reasons, we answer the question arising by holding that in a
proceeding Under Section 163A of the Act it is not open for the Insurer to raise any
defence of negligence on the part of the victim.
10. The appeal will now be listed before regular Bench for disposal on merits, after the
opinion of the larger Bench on the true scope and meaning of the provisions contained
in Section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 is rendered.
11. As the final disposal of the appeal may take some time, we are of the view that
50% of the compensation that is presently lying in deposit in the trial court* in terms of
the Order dated 24-02-2012 should be released to the claimant on due identification.","Appellants: United India Insurance Co. Ltd.

Facts:
Present appeal was filed against order wherein two judge bench of Court
understood the scope of Section 163A of Act to be enabling Appellant to raise
the defence of negligence to counter a claim for compensation. The principal
basis on which the conclusion was reached and recorded was the absence of a
provision similar to Sub-section (4) of Section 140 of Act in Section 163A of
the Act.
Held, while disposing off the appeal:
(i) Grant of compensation under Section 163A of the Act on the basis of the
structured formula was in the nature of a final award and the adjudication
thereunder was required to be made without any requirement of any proof of
negligence of the driver/owner of the vehicle involved in the accident.
Though the aforesaid Section of the Act did not specifically exclude possible
defence of the Appellant based on the negligence of the Respondent to permit
such defence to be introduced by Appellant or to understand the provisions of
Section 163A of the Act to be contemplating any such situation would go
contrary to the very legislative object behind introduction of Section 163A of
the Act. In fact, to understand Section 163A of the Act to permit the
Appellant to raise the defence of negligence would be to bring a proceeding
under Section 163A of the Act at par with the proceeding under Section 166
of the Act which would not only be self-contradictory but also defeat the very

"L. Nageswara Rao, J.
1 . The Appellant is a wholly owned Public Sector Undertaking of the Government of
Orissa. The Appellant finances medium and large scale industries within the State of
Orissa and is also involved in setting up joint sector industries with private
entrepreneurs. The Appellant extended a term loan of Rs. 40,74,000/- to M/s. Josna
Casting Centre Orissa Pvt. Ltd. As the loan amount was not repaid, the Appellant
exercising its power Under Section 29 of the State Finance Corporation Act, 1951, took
over the assets of M/s. Josna Casting Centre Orissa Private Limited on 14-02-1992. On
23-01-1996, the Appellant insured the said assets with Respondent No. 1 for a sum of
Rs. 46,00,000/- under the Miscellaneous Accident Policy, Rs. 60,40,000/- under the Fire
Policy and Rs. 46,00,000/- under the Burglary and House Breaking Policy.
2. The seized assets were put to auction by the Appellant on 22-01-1997 at which point
of time it was detected that some parts of the plant and machinery were missing from
the factory premises. The Appellant registered an FIR on 25-01-1997 in the Remona
Police Station, Balasore regarding the theft/burglary of the plant and machinery. On 07-
02-1997, the Appellant informed Respondent No. 1 about the theft and requested for
issuance of a claim form. A claim was lodged with Respondent No. 1 on 16-12-1997 for
an amount of Rs. 34,40,650/- under the Burglary and House Breaking Policy. The
valuation reports given by GEC, Calcutta, the machines supplier and Alpha Transformer
Ltd., Bhubaneswar were relied upon by the Appellant/Claimant. The claim of the
Appellant was repudiated by Respondent No. 1 on 31-03-1998 on the ground that the
alleged loss did not come within the purview of the insurance policy.
3 . The Appellant filed compensation application No. 45 of 2001 Under Section 12-B
read with Section 36-A of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act,
1969, which was rejected by the MRTP Commission, New Delhi by its Order dated 17-
08-2005. Aggrieved by the said Order, the Appellant has preferred the present Appeal.
4 . Mr. Raj Kumar Mehta, counsel for the Appellant took us through the proposal form
for Burglary and House Breaking Insurance (Business) Premises. The scope of cover in
the said proposal form is as follows:
SCOPE OF COVER
This Insurance Policy provides cover against loss or damage by Burglary or
House breaking i.e. (theft following an actual, forcible and violent entry of
and/or exit from the premises) in respect of contents of offices, warehouses,
shops, etc. and cash in safe or strong room and also damage caused to the
premises, except as detailed below:
It was further submitted by Mr. Mehta that the Rule of contra proferentem would be
applicable to the present case and he relied upon the judgment of this Court in United
India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Orient Treasures (P) Ltd. reported at
MANU/SC/0036/2016 : (2016) 3 SCC 49.
5 . Mr. Mehta submitted that the words 'theft following an actual forcible and violent
entry/or exit from the premises' are with reference only to house breaking and not
burglary. According to him, forcible and violent entry is not necessary for making a
valid claim under the policy. It would be sufficient that there is theft of certain goods
from the factory premises, which fact has been proved by the Appellant. Mr. Mehta
referred to a judgment of this Court in United India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Harchand
Rai Chandan Lal reported in MANU/SC/0803/2004 : (2004) 8 SCC 644 which related
to a claim pertaining to a theft and attempted to distinguish it. He submitted that the
Clause in the policy in that case is different from that involved in the present case. He
urged that the Commission committed an error in relying upon the said judgment to
reject the Claim Application for the Appellant.
6. Mr. Salil Paul, Advocate for Respondent No. 1 submitted that there is no difference in
the policies involved in the case cited supra and the instant case. He also urged that an
insurance policy is akin to a commercial contract and has to be construed strictly. Mr.
Paul submitted that a forcible entry and/or exit is compulsory for maintainability of a
claim under the policy.
7 . Having considered the submissions made on both sides, we are of the opinion that
there is no error committed by the MRTP Commission in rejecting the Claim of the
Appellant. It is clear from the facts of the present case that the Appellant has made out
a case of theft without a forcible entry. The case of the Appellant is that forcible entry is
not required for a claim to be made under the policy. Following the well-accepted
principle that a contract of insurance which is like any other commercial contract should
be interpreted strictly, we are of the opinion that the policy covers loss or damage by
burglary or house breaking which have been explained as theft following an actual,
forcible and violent entry from the premises. A plain reading of the policy would show
that a forcible entry should precede the theft, and unless they are proved, the claim
cannot be accepted. The provisions of the policy in United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v.
Harchand Rai Chandan Lal (supra) read as under:
THE COMPANY HEREBY AGREES subject to the terms and conditions contained
herein endorsed/or otherwise expressed hereon that if,
(a) the property hereinafter described or any part thereof be LOST or
DAMAGED by BURGLARY and/or HOUSE BREAKING, or
(b) ANY DAMAGE be caused to the premises to be made good by the
insured from BURGLARY and/or HOUSE BREAKING or any attempt
thereat.
The term burglary and/or house breaking has been defined in terms of the policy which
are as follows:
'Burglary and/or house breaking' shall mean theft involving entry to or exit from
the premises stated therein by forcible and violent means or following assault or
violence or threat thereof to the insured or to his employees or to the members
of his family.
8. A comparison of the above terms as defined in the policy in the case of United India
Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Harchand Rai Chandan Lal (supra) and the scope of cover in the
proposal form in the instant case are similar. This Court in the said judgment of United
India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Harchand Rai Chandan Lal (supra) considered the scope of a
policy involving burglary and house breaking and held as follows:
The policy is a contract between the parties and both parties are bound by the
terms of contract. As per the definition of the word ""burglary"", followed with
violence, makes it clear that if any theft is committed it should necessarily be
preceded with violence i.e. entry into the premises for committing theft should
involve force or violence or threat to insurer or to his employees or to the
members of his family. Therefore, the element of force and violence is a
condition precedent for burglary and housebreaking. The term 'burglary' as
defined in the English Dictionary means an illegal entry into the building with an
intent to commit crime such as theft. But in absence of violence or force the
insurer cannot claim indemnification against the insurance company. The terms
of the policy have to be construed as it is and we cannot add or subtract
something. Howsoever liberally we may construe the policy but we cannot take
liberalism to the extent of substituting the words which are not intended. It is
true that in common parlance the term ""burglary"" would mean theft but it has to
be preceded with force or violence. If the element of force and violence is not
present then the insurer cannot claim compensation against theft from the
insurance company. This expression appearing in the insurance policy came up
for interpretation before the English Courts and the English Courts in no
uncertain terms laid down that burglary or theft has to be preceded with force or
violence in order to be indemnified by the insurance company. In this connection
reference may be made to the statement of law as summarized in Halsbury's
Laws of England Fourth Edition (2003 Reissue) Para 646. It reads as under:
646. Forcible and violent entry. The terms of a burglary insurance may
exclude liability in certain circumstances unless there is forcible and
violent entry into the premises. If so, the entry must be obtained by the
use of both force and violence or the definition is not satisfied and the
policy does not apply. An entry obtained by turning the handle of an
outside door or by using a skeleton key, though sufficient to constitute
a criminal offence, is not within the policy since the element of violence
is absent. However, an entry obtained by picking the lock or forcing
back the catch by means of an instrument involves the use of violence
and is therefore covered. The policy may be so framed as to apply only
to violent entry from the outside; or the violent entry into a room
within the insured premises may be sufficient. In any case, the violence
must be connected with the act of entry; if the entry is obtained
without violence, the subsequent use of violence to effect the theft, as
for instance where a show-case is broken open, does not bring the loss
within the policy.
9. It is well-settled law that there is no difference between a contract of insurance and
any other contract, and that it should be construed strictly without adding or deleting
anything from the terms thereof. On applying the said principle, we have no doubt that
a forcible entry is required for a claim to be allowed under the policy for burglary/house
breaking.
1 0 . We proceed to deal with the submission made by counsel for the Appellant
regarding the Rule of contra proferentem. The Common Law Rule of construction ""verba
chartarum fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem"" means that ambiguity in the wording
of the policy is to be resolved against the party who prepared it. MacGillivray on
Insurance Law1 deals with the Rule of contra proferentem as follows:
The contra proferentem Rule of construction arises only where there is a
wording employed by those drafting the Clause which leaves the court unable to
decide by ordinary principles of interpretation which of two meanings is the right
one. ""One must not use the Rule to create the ambiguity-one must find the
ambiguity first."" The words should receive their ordinary and natural meaning
unless that is displaced by a real ambiguity either appearing on the face of the
policy or, possibly, by extrinsic evidence of surrounding circumstances.
(footnotes omitted)
Colinvaux's Law of Insurance2 propounds the contra proferentem Rule as under:
Quite apart from contradictory clauses in policies, ambiguities are common in
them and it is often very uncertain what the parties to them mean. In such cases
the Rule is that the policy, being drafted in language chosen by the insurers,
must be taken most strongly against them. It is construed contra proferentem,
against those who offer it. In a doubtful case the turn of the scale ought to be
given against the speaker, because he has not clearly and fully expressed
himself. Nothing is easier than for the insurers to express themselves in plain
terms. The assured cannot put his own meaning upon a policy, but, where it is
ambiguous, it is to be construed in the sense in which he might reasonably have
understood it. If the insurers wish to escape liability under given circumstances,
they must use words admitting of no possible doubt.
But a Clause is only to be contra proferentem in cases of real ambiguity. One
must not use the Rule to create an ambiguity. On must find the ambiguity first.
Even where a Clause by itself is ambiguous if, by looking at the whole policy, its
meaning becomes clear, there is no room for the application of the doctrine. So
also where if one meaning is given to a clause, the rest of the policy becomes
clear, the policy should be construed accordingly. (footnotes omitted)
11. This Court in General Assurance Society Ltd. v. Chandmull Jain and Anr.
reported in MANU/SC/0180/1966 : [1966] 3 SCR 500 held that there is no difference
between a contract of insurance and any other contract except that in a contract of
insurance there is a requirement of uberrima fides, i.e., good faith on the part of the
insured and the contract is likely to be construed contra proferentem, i.e., against the
company in case of ambiguity or doubt. It was further held in the said judgment that
the duty of the Court is to interpret the words in which the contract is expressed by the
parties and it is not for the Court to make a new contract, however reasonable.
12. In United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Orient Treasures (P) Ltd. (supra) cited by the
Counsel for the Appellant, it was held that there is no ambiguity in the insurance policy
and so the Rule of contra proferentem was not applicable. A standard policy of
insurance is different from other Contracts and in a claim under a standard policy the
Rule of contra proferentem is to be applied. The Policy in this case is in a standard
form. The policy for Burglary and House Breaking in United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v.
Orient Treasures (P) Ltd. (supra) and the policy in this case are identical. If there is any
ambiguity or doubt the Clause in the Policy should be interpreted in favour of the
insured. But we see no ambiguity in the relevant Clause of the policy and the Rule of
contra proferentem is not applicable.
13. For the aforementioned reasons, we uphold the order of the MRTP Commission and
dismiss the Appeal with no order as to costs.","Appellants: Industrial Promotion & Investment Corporation of Orissa Ltd.

COMPANY LAW, MRTP AND ALLIED MATTERS
Facts:
The Appellant extended a term loan to a company which was not repaid. The
Appellant took over the assets of that company. The Appellant insured the
said assets with Respondent No. 1 for a certain sum under the Miscellaneous
Accident Policy, the Fire Policy and the Burglary and House Breaking Policy.
Some parts of the plant and machinery were missing when the seized assets
were put to auction by the Appellant. The Appellant registered an FIR
regarding the theft/burglary of the plant and machinery. The Appellant
informed Respondent No. 1 about the theft and requested for issuance of a
claim form. A claim was lodged with Respondent No. 1 under the Burglary and
House Breaking Policy. The claim of the Appellant was repudiated by
Respondent No. 1 on the ground that the alleged loss did not come within the
purview of the insurance policy. The Appellant filed compensation application
which was rejected by the Commission. Aggrieved by the said Order, the
Appellant preferred the present appeal.
Held, while dismissing the appeal:
(i) There was no error committed by Commission in rejecting the claim of the
Appellant. The Appellant made out a case of theft without a forcible entry.
The case of the Appellant was that forcible entry is not required for a claim to
be made under the policy. Following the well-accepted principle that a
contract of insurance which is like any other commercial contract should be
interpreted strictly, the policy covers loss or damage by burglary or house
breaking which had been explained as theft following an actual, forcible and
violent entry from the premises. A plain reading of the policy would showed
that a forcible entry should precede the theft, and unless they were proved,
the claim could not be accepted. [7]
(ii) It is well-settled law that there is no difference between a contract of
insurance and any other contract, and that it should be construed strictly
without adding or deleting anything from the terms thereof. A forcible entry is
required for a claim to be allowed under the policy for burglary/house
breaking. The Common Law Rule of construction ""verba chartarum fortius
accipiuntur contra proferentem"" means that ambiguity in the wording of the
policy is to be resolved against the party who prepared it. If there is any
ambiguity or doubt the Clause in the Policy should be interpreted in favour of
the insured. But there was no ambiguity in the relevant Clause of the policy
and the Rule of contra proferentem was not applicable. [9],[10] and[12]",,,,

1 . C.A. No. 3862 of 2013 is filed by the Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. (for short,
""the Insurance Company"") and C.A. Nos. 3863-3864 of 2013 are filed by the claimants.
These appeals are filed against the common final judgment and order dated 21.09.2012
of the High Court of Orissa at Cuttack in M.A.C.A. No. 1 of 2012 and M.A.C.A. No. 62 of
2012 whereby the High Court partly allowed M.A.C.A. No. 1 of 2012 filed by the
Insurance Company and, in consequence, dismissed M.A.C.A. No. 62 of 2012 filed by
the claimants.
2 . In order to appreciate the issue involved in these appeals, which lies in a narrow
compass, it is necessary to set out the relevant facts in brief infra.
3. On 16.12.2006, one Mathurananda Nayak, a resident of U.S.A., and his mother Jita
Nayak along with two others while coming from Cuttack side towards Aredi on NH No. 5
by a car bearing Registration No. OR-02-S-0565, collided with a truck bearing
Registration No. OR-09-E-6357 driven by its driver which was coming from Paniloili
side. As a result of the said accident, Mathurananda Nayak, Jita Nayak along with driver
of the car sustained injuries and later succumbed to the injuries on the same day.
4 . The claimants in this appeal are wife and sons of the deceased Mathurandanda
Nayak, who was aged about 36 years at the time of accident. He was working as a
Senior Information System Analyst under Traci Cagle Human Resource Representative a
Xilinx Inc-2100 Logic Drive San Jose, CA-95124, U.S.A. and was earning $97,080,60
per annum by way of salary. He had come to India for few days when unfortunately he
met with an accident and died.
5 . The legal heirs of the deceased filed two separate claim applications for
compensation Under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred
to as ""the Act"") before the Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal, Cuttack (for short, ""the
Tribunal"") being MAC No. 25 of 2007 (filed by legal heirs of Mathurananda Nayak) and
MAC No. 30 of 2007 (filed by the legal heirs of Jita Nayak) against the owner of the
vehicle and the Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. being the insurer of the truck.
6 . The owner of the insured vehicle did not appear in spite of service and the
applications were proceeded ex-parte.
7. By a common Award dated 25.10.2011 in MCA No. 25 of 2007, the Tribunal allowed
the applications. So far as M.C.A. No. 25 of 2007 was concerned, the Tribunal held that
the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of truck driver, that the
deceased was aged 36 years, that annual income of the deceased was Rs. 43,68,624/-
(in Indian currency by applying the exchange rate of Rs. 45/- per dollar). The Tribunal
then applied the multiplier of 15 and after deducting 1/3rd towards personal expenses
and adding therein some amount towards conventional heads, awarded a total sum of
Rs. 4,36,95,740/- to the claimants and accordingly directed the Insurance Company to
pay the awarded sum to the claimants along with interest at the rate of 7.5% from the
date of application.
8 . So far as MCA No. 30 of 2007 was concerned, the Tribunal, by applying the
multiplier of 5, awarded a sum of Rs. 1,29,500/- with interest at the rate of 7.5% p.a.
for the death of Jita Nayak.
9. Challenging the said award, the Insurance Company filed MACA No. 1 of 2012 before
the High Court and the claimants filed MACA No. 62 of 2012 for enhancement of
compensation amount awarded to them by the Tribunal.
10. By impugned common judgment dated 21.09.2012, the High Court partly allowed
the appeal filed by the Insurance Company and reduced the compensation amount of
Rs. 4,36,95,740/-, which was awarded by the Tribunal, to Rs. 3,75,00,000/-. It was
held that the Tribunal deducted 1/3rd towards personal expenses of the deceased but
did not deduct anything towards income tax from the salary. The High Court, therefore,
interfered with the determination made by the Tribunal and accordingly re-worked the
compensation and reduced it to Rs. 3,75,00,000/-. All other findings were withheld. As
a consequence, the claimants' appeal for enhancement of compensation was dismissed.
11. Challenging the said judgment of the High Court, the Insurance Company has filed
C.A. No. 3862 of 2013 seeking further reduction in the award of compensation whereas
the claimants have filed C.A. Nos. 3863-3864 of 2013 seeking enhancement in the
compensation.
12. Heard Mr. Vishnu Mehra, learned Counsel for the Insurance Company. None appears
for the claimants though served.
1 3 . Mr. Vishnu Mehra, learned Counsel appearing for the Appellant (Insurance
Company-insurer of the offending vehicle) contended that the High Court though was
right in allowing the appeal filed by the Insurance Company in part and was also right
in reducing the quantum of compensation awarded by the Claims Tribunal from Rs.
4,36,95,740/- to Rs. 3,75,00,000/- but according to him, the High Court should have
further reduced the compensation instead of confining it to Rs. 3,75,00,000/- only.
14. Placing reliance on the decisions in Bijoy Kumar Dugar v. Bidya Dhar Dutta
and Ors. MANU/SC/1027/2006 : 2006 (3) SCC 242,R eshma Kumari and Ors. v.
Madan Mohan And Anr. MANU/SC/0287/2013 : 2013 (9) SCC 65 andU nited India
Insurance Co. Ltd. and Ors. v. Patricia Jean Mahajan and Ors.
MANU/SC/0563/2002 : 2002 (6) SCC 281, learned Counsel contended that the High
Court erred in applying multiplier of 15 for determining the quantum of compensation
payable to the claimants. According to him, keeping in view the law laid down in the
cases cited at the bar, the multiplier of 10 at best could be applied in place of 15.
Learned Counsel further contended that in the absence of any evidence adduced by the
claimants on the issue of future prospects of the deceased in his life, no case is made
out for award of any compensation under this head.
15. Having heard the learned Counsel for the Appellant (Insurance Company) and on
perusal of the entire record of the case, we have formed an opinion to dismiss both the
appeals and, in consequence, are inclined to uphold the order of the High Court which,
in our view, does not call for any interference.
16. On perusal of the decisions cited at the bar and further having regard to the totality
of the facts and circumstances of the case and the concurrent findings of two courts and
on material issues such as the determination of annual income of the deceased, his age,
the number of dependents etc., we do not find any good ground to interfere in the
impugned order. In our view, such findings, apart from being concurrent, cannot be
said to be, in any way, arbitrary and nor they result in awarding a bonanza or a windfall
to the claimants so as to call for further reduction in the compensation awarded by the
High Court.
17. In other words, in our view, what has been eventually awarded to the claimants by
the High Court appears to be just and reasonable compensation within the meaning of
Section 166 of the Act and there does not appear any good ground for further
enhancement under any of the heads including under the head of future prospects as
claimed by the claimants in their appeal and nor any case is made out for further
reduction by applying the lesser multiplier or to make further deduction in the salary
component of the deceased as claimed by the Insurance Company.
1 8 . When we find that under one head, reasonable amount has been awarded and
under another head, nothing has been awarded though it should have been so awarded
and at the same time, we notice that eventual figure of the award of compensation
payable to the claimants appears to be just and reasonable then in such eventuality, we
do not consider it proper to interfere in such award in our appellate jurisdiction Under
Article 136 of the Constitution. In other words, if by applying the tests and guidelines,
we find that overall award of compensation is just and fair, then, in our view, such
award deserves to be upheld in claimants' favour. We find it to be so in the facts of this
case having taken note of all relevant facts and circumstances of the case.
19. In the light of foregoing discussion, we find no merit in the appeals, i.e., the appeal
filed by the Insurance Company seeking further reduction in the compensation and the
appeals filed by the claimants seeking enhancement in the compensation and
accordingly dismiss the appeals and, in consequence, uphold the order of the High
Court calling no interference therein.

Case Category:
COMPENSATION MATTER - INSURER/OWNERS LIABILITY MATTERS
Facts:
As a result of the accident, the deceased and his mother along with driver of
the car sustained injuries and later succumbed to the injuries. The Claimants
were wife and sons of the deceased who was working as a Senior Information
System Analyst in a foreign country. He had come to India for few days when
unfortunately he met with an accident and died. The legal heirs of the
deceased filed two separate claim applications for compensation under
Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (Act) before the Tribunal against
the owner of the vehicle and the Insurance Company/insurer of the offending
vehicle. The Tribunal allowed the applications. The Tribunal held that the
accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending driver,
that the deceased was aged 36 years, that annual income of the deceased
was Rs. 43,68,624/-. The Tribunal then applied the multiplier of 15 and after
deducting 1/3rd towards personal expenses and adding therein some amount
towards conventional heads, awarded a total sum of Rs. 4,36,95,740/- to the
Claimants and accordingly directed the Insurance Company to pay the
awarded sum to the claimants along with interest. In second application, the
Tribunal, by applying the multiplier of 5, awarded a sum of Rs. 1,29,500/-
with interest for the death of mother of deceased . Both the Insurance
Company and the Claimants filed appeals before the High Court. By impugned
common judgment, the High Court partly allowed the appeal filed by the
Insurance Company and reduced the compensation amount of Rs.
4,36,95,740/-, which was awarded by the Tribunal, to Rs. 3,75,00,000/-. It
was held that the Tribunal deducted 1/3rd towards personal expenses of the
deceased but did not deduct anything towards income tax from the salary. All
other findings were withheld. As a consequence, the Claimants' appeal for
enhancement of compensation was dismissed. Challenging the said judgment
of the High Court, the Insurance Company filed appeal seeking further
reduction in the award of compensation whereas the Claimants filed appeal
seeking enhancement in the compensation.
Held, while dismissing the appeals:
(i) Having regard to the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case and
the concurrent findings of two courts and on material issues such as the
determination of annual income of the deceased, his age, the number of
dependents etc., there was no good ground to interfere in the impugned
order. Such findings, apart from being concurrent, could not be said to be, in
any way, arbitrary and nor they result in awarding a bonanza or a windfall to
the claimants so as to call for further reduction in the compensation awarded
by the High Court. [16]
(ii) When it was found that under one head, reasonable amount has been
awarded and under another head, nothing has been awarded though it should
have been so awarded and at the same time, eventual figure of the award of
compensation payable to the Claimants appeared to be just and reasonable
then in such eventuality, there was no need of interference. Overall award of
compensation was just and fair, then, in our view, such award deserved to be
upheld in claimants' favour. [18]",,,,
